Apple is working with Goldman Sachs Bank for the credit card. Reporting from CNBC. The privilege of this card is that users can register through their iPhone and can directly access the card within minutes. </span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dq3b9kcc8\"><span >Apple Credit Card 7 features you need to know.</span></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span ><strong>Usage Credit Card: </strong>This card can be used through Apple Pay which has been operating since 2014. On its official page, Apple writes \"Apple Card lives on your iPhone in a <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-create-your-money-making-mobile-application.html\">digital wallet application</a>, and it makes new things possible. You can register at any time and can immediately start using it with Apple Pay. \"</span></li>\n<li><span ><strong>Titanium Card:</strong> If payment is not accepted by Apple Pay, there is a minimalist titanium card that looks slim. On that card, only your name is written without other personal information.

Apple ensures there are no fees, including late fees, international fees, or annual fees. \"Even if you miss payments, we won't charge a penalty fee as most banks do,\" said Apple executive Jennifer Bailey.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span >Transparency of Apple Credit Card:</span></strong><span > Apple's goal is to make customers easier to balance payments, rather than complicate things. It also heralded the simplicity and transparency of this card. For example, Apple will use maps and services to list purchase activities in a way that is easy to understand, instead of merchant codes that sometimes make credit card statements difficult to understand. Purchases are grouped in color-coded categories, such as food, entertainment, and others. Expenditure trends are also displayed for several weeks or months.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span >Payment Options of Apple Credit Card: </span></strong><span >Payment options are displayed dynamically, so users can decide how fast users want to pay their bills. Annual interest rates will range from 13-24 percent.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span >Privacy and Security of Apple Credit Card: </span></strong><span >Apple also emphasizes the aspects of privacy and security. The tech giant ensures that no one knows what you are buying, where you are buying it, or how much you are paying for it. It said the analysis for expenditures was carried out on devices, not on Apple servers. Goldman Sachs also will not sell purchase data to third parties. In addition, Apple Card uses a special security chip to store card numbers and every transaction has a one time password (OTP). The other layer of security also features a face identification and fingerprint scanner on the <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-migrate-from-iphone-to-android-and-android-to-iphone.html\">iPhone</a>.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span >Hardware, software, and services</span></strong><span >. Apple is uniquely positioned to make the most significant changes in the credit card experience in 50 years. Apple Pay is accepted by more than 70 percent of US retailers and will take effect in more than 40 countries by the end of the year. This service is expected to exceed 10 billion transactions this year.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p> Read next: <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/tips-to-change-ringtones-of-iphone-6.html\">Tips to change ringtone of iPhone 6.</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span >Nowadays, users have preferred to use mobile devices to desktop PCs. Surfing on the Internet is one of the most popular activities for which it is not necessary to sit in front of a computer or laptop. People publish status on social networks and launch games through their phone.</span></p>\n<p><span >In this context, using Android emulators to play mobile games or run an application on a computer may seem counterintuitive. But in fact, the number of people using Android emulators is increasing. Why? Let's look at <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/5-important-factors-to-consider-before-buying-a-speaker.html\">5 reasons</a> why a user may need to use an Android Emulator on their PC.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dlbgjln70\"><span >1. Android emulator gives you a bigger screen</span></h2>\n<p><span >Keeping a close eye on your phone harms your eye. This is certainly not very good for your health. Moving from a small screen of a telephone to a large screen of a computer raises its head, also, the <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-fix-blue-screen-problem-of-microsoft-windows.html\">large screen has a better display</a>. This greatly improves your accuracy when pressed in games.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dlbgjln81\"><span >2. Saving the mobile phone battery</span></h2>\n<p><span ><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/take-photo-from-your-smartphone-and-earn-money.html\">Cell phone</a> batteries are small and lightweight for portability, but this also means that they cannot last very long. Powerful games heat-up your phone and the battery runs down very quickly. No one wants to lose the battle because your phone is down and disconnected at the very last moment. Using the Android emulator, you never have to worry about power. You can watch videos or stay <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/5-best-smartphone-to-optimize-your-gaming-experience.html\">connected in your favorite game</a> for as long as you need.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dlbgjln92\"><span >3. Launch multiple applications or use multiple accounts at the same time.</span></h2>\n<p><span >Imagine that you could watch a video in any video sharing application without interrupting your <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-use-whatsapp-without-a-phone-number.html\">conversation on WhatsApp</a> or using multiple accounts for the game at the same time. That's fine, isn't it? Although not all Android emulators have this feature, with Nox App Player you can simultaneously run multiple instances of Android on your PC screen. Control your game in one of them, watch the video on the other and watch the conversation on WhatsApp on one big screen! </span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dlbgjln93\"><span >4. The emulator allows you to replace the top-end Android phone</span></h2>\n<p><span ><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/tips-on-choosing-a-tablet-and-smartphone-to-play-games.html\">Mobile games</a> are not just casual games. More and more hardcore games appear with a deep plot and complex gameplay. Accordingly, for a smooth and fast game, the graphics and display of the top device are required. The Android emulator will save you the budget to replace your phone since you can get for free this most “virtual, top-end Android phone” on your PC.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dlbgjln94\"><span >5. Access to mobile applications from a PC</span></h2>\n<p><span >With the growing number of smartphones and mobile networks, many applications meet the specific needs of people. However, some of them, such as Instagram, are designed to work only on mobile devices. For people who would like to access these services in a more “traditional” way from a PC, an Android emulator is a great solution.</span></p>\n<p><span >So you want to try the Android emulator? Download Nox App Player to take full advantage of the benefits mentioned above.</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1djdvj4vt0\"> </h1>\n<p><strong>Buying a speaker is certainly not the same as buying a smartphone.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Why did it happen?</em></p>\n<p><span >The reason is simple because in buying speakers, we must pay attention to <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/top-seven-tips-for-buying-a-gaming-computer.html\">several important factors </a>such as the original sound quality of the speaker, type of speaker, and so on.</span></p>\n<p><span >So, Today I am going to suggest you at least <strong>5 factors that are usually used by many experts before buying a speaker.</strong></span></p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1djdvj4vu1\"><strong><span >1. Listen Sound Quality</span></strong></h4>\n<p><span >Don't trust other people if the A or B speaker sounds good. Regardless of the popularity of those who say that the sound of a good speaker is different in every ear that hears it. Or in other words, the sound of the speaker is each individual's taste.</span></p>\n<p><span >Therefore, when we want to buy a speaker, we have to directly listen to the sound produced by the speaker. </span></p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1djdvj4vv2\"><strong><span >2. Pay Attention to Types of Speakers</span></strong></h4>\n<p><span >Nowadays, there are many types of speakers that we can choose from various brands. </span></p>\n<p><span >For the types of speakers, We know that there are several types such as </span><em><span >bookshelf speakers, soundbar speakers, floor-standing speakers, subwoofers</span></em><span > and many more. Here we must choose which one is suitable for us to use.</span></p>\n<p><span >Suppose we want to use speakers on our PC or computer, then the type of speaker that usually matches a PC or computer is the type of </span><em><span >bookshelf speaker</span></em><span > or </span><em><span >soundbar speaker.</span></em></p>\n<p><span >Then when we want to use the speakers on our television for entertainment purposes such as watching movies or karaoke with the family, the </span><em><span >floor-standing speaker</span></em><span > is the most appropriate.</span></p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1djdvj4vv3\"><strong><span >3. The Room where the Speaker is used. </span></strong></h4>\n<p><span >Not only the type of speaker and the sound of the speaker that must be considered, but the room where the speaker is used should also be taken into consideration. For example, a narrow room with an area of ​​6 x 5 square meters is not possible to use speakers with large sizes.</span></p>\n<p><span >Similarly, in a room such as an auditorium, it is certainly not possible to use small </span><em><span >speakers</span></em><span > such as </span><em><span >bookshelf speakers</span></em><span > or </span><em><span >portable speakers.</span></em></p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1djdvj4vv4\"><strong><span >4. Adjust to the Right Device</span></strong></h4>\n<p><span >To present the maximum sound, a speaker must be paired with an </span><em><span >amplifier</span></em><span > or </span><em><span >receiver</span></em><span > that can deliver the appropriate </span><em><span >power.</span></em><span > For example, a speaker needs 30 - 100 Watts power to be able to work smoothly, the amplifier used must adjust to the speaker power.</span></p>\n<p><span >Then when we want to make the speakers that we have </span><em><span >multi-channel</span></em><span > so that it can produce better sound. My recommendation is to pair the speakers that we have with other speakers of the same type and brand. Or if you want to be different, that's fine, but with my experience, it is best to pair the same brands. </span></p>\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/review-the-5-most-effective-windows-backup-softwares.html\">Review of the 5 Most Effective Windows Backup Softawares. </a></p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1djdvj4vv5\"><strong><span >5. Speaker Optimization</span></strong></h4>\n<p><span >This one might only be done after we install the speakers in the room. The first is to optimize the sound released by making arrangements such as </span><em><span >treble, bass,</span></em><span > and others.</span></p>\n<p><span >Then the next is the position of the speakers that are placed is safe, comfortable and can guarantee to provide maximum performance? If not, it's better to reposition again. So, have a nice day. </span></p>\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-use-whatsapp-without-a-phone-number.html\">How to use WhatsApp Without Phone Number? </a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>WhatsApp is a widespread text messaging, voice call and chat application used by many users around the world. WhatsApp Messenger is a complete messaging application that allows us to send text messages, photos, and media files for free. There are versions of WhatsApp for iPhone, BlackBerry, Android, <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-use-viber-for-windows-featured-some-interesting-updates-including-video-chats.html\">Windows</a> Phone and Nokia, and these phones can save all your contact and chat data! WhatsApp uses the same Internet data transfer scheme that you use for email and web browsing. This allows you not to spend money on messages and stay in touch with friends.<br><br>Since many users use devices that do not have a SIM card like a mobile phone (such as a tablet or desktop PC), the problem is that in order to use WhatsApp without a phone number, you need to use one trick. It happens that you can not use your smartphone because of a breakdown. And although some service centers repair mobile phones at the client, troubleshooting can be delayed.<br><br><strong>Today we are going to show you how to use WhatsApp without a phone</strong> so that you can install and configure WhatsApp on a tablet or other device without a SIM card. Follow the manual to use this trick.<br><strong>Set up WhatsApp without using a phone number</strong><br>First, download the latest version of WhatsApp from the mobile app store. If you’re an old user, you can later restore WhatsApp chats to Google Drive. After the download is complete, install WhatsApp on your smartphone, tablet or PC, and then close it. Do not proceed to the next step.<br><br>Now you will need to enter a mobile phone number to which the application will send an SMS message with a verification code. On the Internet, there are several free <strong><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/pinc-or-virtual-reality-for-your-iphone.html\">virtual number registration services</a></strong> for verification in various online services. We note right away that most of them, in our case, will not work. Firstly, some services use the same number for everyone, and secondly, WhatsApp itself checks the validity of the number you enter. It is difficult to say exactly which parameters are evaluated by the messenger algorithm, but out of the few we entered, it accepted only the one that was obtained using the method described below.</p>\n<p>So, in order to successfully verify the mobile phone number, you need to install an application called<strong> \"Virtual SIM\"</strong>. This must be done because the program will provide you with a virtual mobile phone number to which WhatsApp will send a confirmation code. After registering with WhatsApp, you can delete it. As a bonus, after installing Virtual SIM, you will receive 0.50 euros into your account, which you can use to make calls to any landline phones around the world.</p>\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-disable-the-built-in-browser-in-the-facebook-app-for-android.html\">How disable built-in Facebook Browser in Smartphone</a>. <br><br>Further, everything is very simple. Open the WhatsApp application and as a phone number for verification, enter the number received in Virtual SIM and click continue. Now wait a few seconds and you will receive a verification code in the Virtual SIM application. Next, copy this code into WhatsApp.<br><br>After that, you can log into WhatsApp without a phone number.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>An ideal candidate should have a deep knowledge of the required <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/why-you-should-join-tefl-programs-in-spain.html\">programming</a> language. However, it would be more valuable if he or she knew other coding languages to become more flexible and be able to work in future projects. It is also essential that developers have the ability to communicate effectively with all the members of the team and, in particular, with the customer to make sure that all the needs are understood at the beginning of each project thus saving development time and later changes. The software world is a fast paced, ever evolving environment and thus it is necessary to be able to meet very strict deadlines, be flexible and be creative. Furthermore, requirements often change during the <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/10-important-tips-to-place-a-good-web-design-course.html\">course of large projects</a>, thus having experience in lean programming is essential. While establishing which are the desired skills of candidates is a relatively simple task, finding and especially evaluating such candidates before hiring them is particularly complex. It is easy to imagine how time consuming it would be to carry out some interviews and then perform technical tests where candidates show their qualities. In particular, this could become complicated because candidates may not be willing to code unpaid during an interview and evaluating some soft skills like team work is can be complicated unless certain people are in the interview. This can be difficult when everybody is busy with his or her own work.</p>\n<p>Therefore, traditional methods to recruit candidates such as adverts in websites might be inadequate because it difficult or impossible to determine whether a candidate has the expertise and talent. It would appear interesting to be able to evaluate these important skills. As a result, hackathons have become an attractive option.</p>\n<p><strong>What is hackathon?</strong> Hackathons are an original and effective way to find candidates for open tech positions by engaging hidden talents with coding competitions. During online challenges professionals can show off their skills and get hired. This way, organisations can discover &amp; recruit new talents, assess programming skills, improve time-to-hire, and source innovations.</p>\n<p>Hackathons offer a unique environment for both recruiters and job seekers. Why? Recruiters can prepare specific problems of interest to different companies. For instance a group of companies could be interested in SAP or maybe in C++ whereas companies looking for web developers may prefer problems based on PHP.</p>\n<p>Check also: Hackathon Ideas (upcoming hackathon)</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1749\" src=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/media/posts/165/How-to-Find-a-Perfect-Developer-for-you-Company.jpg\" alt=\"How to Find a Perfect Developer for you Company\" width=\"1709\" height=\"803\"></p>\n<p>Why would candidates attend to such an event? Hackathons, or coding competitions, are popular because of the rewards, which may or may not include a financial price. But usually, it is the prestige that attracts the most brilliant professionals, thus becoming a win-win situation for both recruiters and job-seekers.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Hello, dear readers. In this article, we will tell you about business insurance.</p>\n<p><strong>Today you will learn:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>For what it is necessary to insurance business;</li>\n<li>Types of risks in business;</li>\n<li>Which company provide risk-free business insurance services and how much does it cost?</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dhvpqn980\">What is Business Insurance?</h2>\n<p>Business insurance is a product through which you can save your capital and continue working without financial loss.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dhvpqn991\">Why insure your business?</h2>\n<p>This question may arise in those who are just starting their own business, sometimes by trial and error.</p>\n<p>If you have created the whole business of your life, have a good client base and create competition to other companies, then you should take care that it does not collapse in a single moment because of unforeseen circumstances.</p>\n<p><strong>Of course</strong>, many young entrepreneurs are trying to save their own money and do not believe that there can be a fire, an accident, or that someone will fail or someone will \"throw\" on the money. But you will agree, it is pleasant to work and know that at any moment everything can be restored, at the expense of the received insurance payment.</p>\n<p>It can be concluded that insurance for your business is an additional \"safety cushion\" for your business. The main thing is to evaluate the business and choose the right insurance product.</p>\n<p><strong>Therefore,</strong> if you are just starting to develop, do not negatively react to proposals from insurance companies. It is better to carefully study the commercial proposals of several insurers and purchase a lucrative contract.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dhvpqn992\">Advantages of business insurance.</h2>\n<p>Advantages of business insurance are obvious:</p>\n<p><strong>Protection against financial losses and bankruptcy.</strong> In a market economy, opening a business is a risky business. The customer base will not be accumulated in one day. To reduce the losses that may arise as a result of commercial activities, it is worth buying insurance protection.</p>\n<p><strong>Protection of real estate.</strong> The room in which you operate may be affected by a fire, explosion or natural disasters. The cost of restoration can be large. It is through insurance that you can repair the property.</p>\n<p><strong>Staff insurance.</strong> The availability of experienced and qualified personnel is the key to the introduction of a successful business. The protected team feels calmer and loyal to the company's management.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dhvpqn993\">Entrepreneurial risks.</h2>\n<p>Every business activity involves high risks. The best way to protect yourself against possible losses is to purchase a business insurance agreement.</p>\n<p><strong>The main types of risks:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>External</strong>. This type of risk does not depend on the activities of the company. This includes inflation and changing demand in the market.</li>\n<li><strong>Internal.</strong> These are risks that arise solely through the fault of the enterprise itself. Here it is possible to single out a strike or an incorrectly drawn up business plan for the development of one's own business.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>By the factor of occurrence,</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Political,</strong> connected and changing the political situation in the country;</li>\n<li><strong>Economic</strong>, arising due to adverse changes in the economy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Classification of risks in the area of occurrence:</strong></p>\n<p>Production risk associated with non-fulfillment of obligations to produce goods or services;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Commercial risk arising from the sale of goods and services;</li>\n<li>Financial risk is related to non-fulfillment of financial obligations;</li>\n<li>Insurance risk is associated with possible losses that will arise as a result of the occurrence of the insured event.</li>\n<li>An innovative risk is associated with the emergence of new technologies and the emergence of a new, more sophisticated product on the market.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the correct choice of insurance protection it is worth taking into account:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What risks can be at the enterprise?</li>\n<li>The probability of occurrence of each risk;</li>\n<li>Losses that you incur as a result of each risk.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The assessment of future damage is based on the following methods:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysis of all company activities;</li>\n<li>Comparison of own forecasts and data obtained from the involved specialists;</li>\n<li>The use of the experience of other enterprises that work in a similar industry.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dhvpqn994\">Types of business insurance.</h2>\n<p>Even the most courageous entrepreneurs, who are not the first day in business, do not forget to \"make themselves straws.\" Business insurance is an obligatory process that can not be neglected and postponed for later.</p>\n<p>There are several types of risk insurance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Property insurance.</strong> In this case, the products, equipment, and premises are subject to insurance;</li>\n<li><strong>From the production break.</strong> For example, you have a fire in the company. You will not be able to quickly restore the workflow. It is necessary to spend time on repair work, purchase of new equipment. Do not forget about the wages of employees, which no one has canceled and all mandatory tax deductions. Insurance will be able to compensate for all the expenses that you incur in such a situation;</li>\n<li><strong>Insurance of business liability to third parties</strong>. Under this agreement, all liabilities to partners will be insured. For example, also in the event of a fire, you will not be able to fulfill the obligations in full. The insurance company compensates all penalties, which will be exposed as a result of the occurrence of the insured event.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dhvpqn995\">Property insurance</h2>\n<p>Let's say that you opened a business, rented an office or bought your own premises. In addition to the premises, you had to buy the necessary equipment and furniture. If it is a question of big business and production of goods, then the expensive equipment is needed. Here all the acquired property can suffer at any moment.</p>\n<p>Under the contract, you can ensure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The building itself and the buildings and buildings attached to it;</li>\n<li>Material values;</li>\n<li>Money in the vault or safe;</li>\n<li>Techniques: computers, telephones, fax machines, printers, scanners, etc .;</li>\n<li>Interior items.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dhvpqn996\">Insurance against production interruption.</h2>\n<p>Business can not work around the clock. There can be scheduled days for rest - these are weekends and holidays. But what to do with unplanned work days, which can appear due to force majeure circumstances?</p>\n<p>As a result of downtime, you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Losses in the form of lost profits;</li>\n<li>You will have to spend money on damages, and this is unplanned expenses;</li>\n<li>Have to pay salaries to their employees, taxes, and rents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compensate for all costs will help the insurance company.</p>\n<p>Also, it is worth remembering about an additional useful insurance package:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Voluntary insurance of employees ;</li>\n<li>Civil liability to third parties;</li>\n<li>Vehicle insurance company;</li>\n<li>Insurance of goods during transportation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dhvpqn997\">Liability Insurance.</h2>\n<p>This is an excellent protection, if, due to unforeseen circumstances, you have caused harm to the customer and he has a complaint.</p>\n<p>Let's say you decided to open a beauty salon. Your employee, when applying a mask to the client, incorrectly mixed the cosmetic substances and the client appeared redness and burns on the face. Agree, a very unpleasant situation.</p>\n<p>If the injured customer makes a claim to the salon, you will have to pay compensation. But you will not be paid, but the insurance company, within the insured amount.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dhvpqn998\">Small Business Insurance.</h2>\n<p>For a small business, any unforeseen situation can turn into a great tragedy. In most cases, there are no reserve funds for small businesses, and due to working capital, the damage cannot be compensated. In such a situation, insurance protection will help to minimize possible losses.</p>\n<p>At the moment, small business insurance includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Business Liability Insurance;</li>\n<li>Property insurance;</li>\n<li>Possible losses in production.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is also worth knowing that if a novice businessman wants to take a loan from a bank to open a business, the bank will take care of the security of assets that will serve as collateral. In this case, the registration of a business insurance agreement will become a prerequisite.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dhvpqn999\">Medium Business Insurance.</h2>\n<p>Today, economic conditions cannot be called stable. This applies to the whole world. Every day you can hear about financial crises, which can affect the activities of large companies. But how to survive afloat representatives of medium-sized businesses? This business is in a special risk zone.</p>\n<p>Experienced insurance consultants advise to acquire protection against force majeure, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fires;</li>\n<li>Accidents, including utilities;</li>\n<li>Change or illness of employees;</li>\n<li>Official crimes;</li>\n<li>Equipment failure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cost of business insurance services.</strong></p>\n<p>Insurance companies offer several business insurance programs. You can make a calculation even on the official website of the insurance company <a href=\"https://www.roseboroughinsurance.com/business-insurance-tulsa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.roseboroughinsurance.com/business-insurance-tulsa/</a>, or by calling the operator on a toll-free customer support phone.</p>\n<p>The listed companies have a comprehensive business insurance program that guarantees full protection in the event of an insured event.</p>",
