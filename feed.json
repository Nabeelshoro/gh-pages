It is also better not to fill the hard disk so that the system does not slow down.</span></p>\n<p><span >In general, there are 3 options for storing files: burn to DVDs, store in the cloud, or purchase an external hard drive.</span></p>\n<p><span >I will say right away: you should not save the distributions of the programs, because the programs are changing, updated and it is better to download them again from the Internet. Now the time has passed when the programs were stored for several years.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span >Let's look at each case</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span >1. Burning to DVD</span></strong><span > is a cheap option, but inconvenient because when you need something, you will need to search for a disc. Also, the disc is easily damaged and scratched, so the reliability is not very good here. The good thing about this method is that it is very inexpensive. And perhaps that's all.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span >2. Store in the cloud. </span></strong><span >Many cloud services give you disk space for a price. There are two disadvantages here: a constant subscription fee, as well as the risk that the disk on the server will simply burn out.</span></p>\n<p><span >And in the contract for such services, it is written in black and white that the organization is not responsible for failures in work. And of course, you need a powerful Internet channel to upload and download your wealth, and your account can be broken and all your files can become public. In the cloud, I store those files that I need constant access from different devices. It is very convenient!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span >3. The best way</span></strong><span > is an external HDD hard drive. In my opinion, the most reliable. How to choose it? There are two factors here: capacity and reviews. I always choose according to reviews and try to take those models that have already received the proper number of ratings from real users (I don't make new models, I take from a year).</span></p>\n<p><span >You should not buy a 2 terabyte disk at once, it is better to buy two disks per terabyte or 500 gigabytes each. One to use as a backup. After all, the more places where information will be recorded, the more likely it will be saved. The external drive is easily connected via USB, and in the \"This PC\" section it appears as a regular hard drive.</span></p>\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-connect-airpods-to-android.html\">How to connect AirPods to Android </a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong><span >Almost every person uses wireless headphones now, as it is convenient. For example, without additional cables, you can listen to music or podcasts while walking, cycling, or just jogging. Headsets from various manufacturers are available for sale, but AirPods are the most popular. Because the manufacturer of these headphones is Apple, many people have an understandable question: how to connect AirPods to Android. It's very simple, you don't even have to install additional applications and perform complex actions!</span></strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1eggggve30\"><span >How to connect AirPods to Android phones?</span></h2>\n<p><span >It is necessary to make a reservation that AirPods are ordinary wireless headphones that connect to a device via Bluetooth. And here it doesn't matter what operating system is installed on your smartphone or tablet. So it is possible to pair the Apple headset with an Android phone and through the standard settings options. We have compiled step-by-step instructions, so we recommend that you familiarize yourself with it:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span >Open the smart phone settings.</span></li>\n<li><span >Go to the \"Bluetooth\" section and move the slider to the right next to the corresponding item. You can also activate the option through the quick access shutter by opening it, and then clicking on the icon with the logo of the desired mode.</span></li>\n<li><span >We open the case where the AirPods themselves are located. Note that before starting pairing, the headphones must be returned to the case if you removed them from there before. </span></li>\n<li><span >On the back of the case, we find an almost invisible button. It is easy to feel it. We hold it down, and then we wait a few seconds until the white or green indicator lights up. It all depends on what generation your headset is.</span></li>\n<li><span >We return to the phone, or rather to the \"Bluetooth\" tab. Refreshing the page and see that the name of Apple headphones has appeared on the list with available devices. Click on it to perform pairing. If the connection is made for the first time, then in the window that appears, you will need to select \"Accept\".</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span >And that's it, now you can listen to music through AirPods connected to your Android smartphone. Here the principle of action is standard - click on the desired track and adjust the volume. You can also chat on the phone, record voice messages, and use other features of the wireless headset. But several nuances should be paid attention to.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1eggggve41\"><span >Features of using AirPods with Android</span></h2>\n<p><span >As you know, AirPods are primarily designed for Apple smartphones, so Android phone owners may face certain restrictions. Firstly, the Siri voice assistant will be completely inaccessible, but you can use the rest of the assistants, but only after additional configuration.</span></p>\n<p><span >Secondly, if you take the earpiece out of your ear, the melody will continue to play. To stop a track, you need to manually open the player on your smartphone, and then press the pause button. But this flaw can be fixed by installing the AndroPods app. It allows you to customize the wireless headset in detail, including turning on the display of the charge in the status bar and activating some gestures.</span></p>\n<p><span >So, we took a quick look at how to connect AirPods to Android correctly. As practice shows, it is almost always possible to pair with headphones the first time. If you still have additional questions, then ask them in the comments. We will try to answer them and help you solve the problem!</span></p>\n<p>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/5-reasons-to-move-from-word-to-google-docs.html\">5 reason to move from Word to Google Doc</a></p>",

It is not necessary that all participants in the discussion have a Google account.

It came in handy for me at work.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1efr74bk43\"><span >Google Docs is handy on your phone</span></h2>\n<p><span >I never thought that texts on the phone could be relatively convenient to edit. But it turned out that this is possible. Not only without functionality limitations, but even with a couple of new, in comparison with a computer editor, chips. For example, mobile dox is able to add words, you can dictate text. The mobile keyboard also helps.</span></p>\n<p><span >By the way, you can also dictate text on a computer using Ctrl-Shift-S.</span></p>\n<p><span >It is clear that all mobile platforms are supported: existing (Google and Apple) and any new ones (via a web browser that is in any operating system).</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1efr74bk44\"><span >Google Docs is growing faster</span></h2>\n<p><span >The rapid development of Google's text editor is understandable. The functionality has not yet caught up with Word, so new features appear frequently. For example, text comparison has recently appeared.</span></p>\n<p><span >And here's another trick that hasn't appeared in paid Word for decades. If you typed the text in the wrong layout, in Google Docs you can fix it with one mouse button.</span></p>\n<p><span >In order to work with text without an Internet connection, open offline access to it.</span></p>\n<p><span >The file will update in the cloud the next time you connect to the network.</span></p>\n<p>Also read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-play-minecraft-on-your-phone.html\">How to play Minecraft on your phone</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-enable-miracast-on-android.html\">How to enable Miracast on Android</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/5-benefits-of-getting-managed-web-hosting.html\">5 benefits of getting managed web hosting</a></li>\n</ul>",

For example, the cord could be damaged, and the device must have been at a close distance to the monitor. But a few years ago, third-party developers introduced technology for remote transmission of information, called Miracast.</span></p>\n<p><span >For this option to work, the TV and the phone must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network. There are no more restrictions. After activating the mode, it will be possible to display the image and videos from the smartphone on the TV screen or another monitor.

            "content_html": "<p><span >If you are planning to start your online career, surely you need a website to show your products. All online businesses rely on website hosting to keep them online and connected to the world. There was a time when more people preferred to take full responsibility for their online servers. But today's world is faster and busier. That is why they prefer to purchase managed web hosting. Here I have to guide you on why you should also do the same.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ednt6cls0\"><strong><span >Save on operating expenses</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span >Many people have the misconception that acquiring managed hosting is more expensive because you also have to pay for the service. You realize how wrong it is only after having experienced it. There are many lower and hidden costs of managing accommodation yourself. You have to invest in a lot of resources, and even then, you won't get the results you expected.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ednt6clt1\"><strong><span >No need to hire support staff</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span >It's not just about one person's job. You need database administrators, system administrators, and support staff to ensure that your servers stay online and up and running. A minor problem can cost your business a lot. If you buy managed </span><u><span ><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/why-wordpress-what-are-the-advantages.html\">WordPress hosting</a>,</span></u><span > you won't have to invest in hiring and retaining a team of professionals.</span></p>\n<p><span >The service provider will already have the best professionals on the job. They are more experienced in hosting management than you are with many resources you can probably afford.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ednt6clt2\"><strong><span >Safer and more maintained</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span >Managed hosting service providers use security and seamless maintenance as their unique selling points. Online threats have only increased over time. Some do it for fun and others for ransom. You won't have the resources and personnel to fight an army of haters who are always looking for weaknesses to exploit.</span></p>\n<p><span >A professional service that manages website hosting for a living would know exactly how to fend off any attack that might come this way. They will keep their hosting optimized and updated to guarantee the best performance. This will take a lot of your worries off your shoulders.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ednt6clu3\"><strong><span >24 Hours monitoring</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span >The employees you hire will only work hours before. They will also need casual, medical, and other permits. The hosting requires full-time monitoring to make sure everything continues to run smoothly. This means that you can hire a staff of three different hours with support staff or purchase managed accommodation. The last option is definitely more efficient and cheaper.</span></p>\n<p><span >All of these service providers offer </span><u><span >24-hour monitoring</span></u><span >. First, they keep everything so well maintained so there is no problem. On top of that, they keep an alert staff on call to predict any potential problems before they happen and resolve them without you noticing.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ednt6clu4\"><strong><span >Get the best out of your backup</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span >Not keeping a backup of your data is not a smart move in the 21st century. People use backup copies to protect even personal data. So there shouldn't be a question of not keeping your business data backed up. The problem, the backup also requires a safe space and a system that automatically updates the data. Instead of investing more in backups and Shared hosting at the same time, it is more viable to acquire a professional service that can do it for you.</span></p>\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null\">Factors to consider before choosing a web hosting provider </a></p>",

To add special effects, you can use effects inside the editor, as well as special masks and filters. In the video, you can legally add any track from the free library of the application, or upload your audio.</span></p>\n<p><span >Popular TikToker are already actively monetizing their accounts. How to profit from your TikTok account in 2020? We will analyze the proven methods:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span >Native advertising</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span >It’s acceptable to advertise other accounts, brands, products, and services. This is a well-known format that is already successfully sold on Instagram. Experienced bloggers recommend observing the main rule of native advertising: we focus on the quality of content, advertising should be no more than 30%.</span></p>\n<p><span >Let's analyze one of the options for native advertising in TikTok. Suppose a music group has recorded a new track and wants to attract the attention of the audience to this event. Next, the group manager looks for bloggers with a suitable target audience and buys a placement from them (prices depending on the popularity of the tiktoker). The placement may be a video recording for the specified track.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span >Live broadcasts</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span >Some time ago, TikToker blew up the story of a professional player from China. Meng Lei streamed his game in the application, one of these broadcasts gathered 22 million viewers who sent donations to the player for 1 million yuan, which amounted to about 167 thousand dollars!</span></p>\n<p><span >That is, another option for monetizing an account in TikTok is to receive donations (thanks in monetary terms, in the application it is called coins or tips, in an average of 100 coins it costs about $ 1) from the audience. Such broadcasts are available for tickers with many followers from 1000, TikTok will take 20% of donations. Amounts can be withdrawn to a bank card or online wallet, withdrawal is available from $ 10.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span >Influence marketing</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span >The large reach in TikTok surely attracts large and medium-sized advertisers, despite the inability to put a direct link to your project. In-app advertising inspires user confidence and strengthens the brand position. This type of monetization is available to bloggers from 10-20 thousand subscribers. Usually, influence-marketing in TikTok includes the following activities:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span >creating viral videos</span></em></li>\n<li><em><span >Challenges</span></em></li>\n<li><em><span >publishing brand hashtags videos</span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span >Affiliate Programs</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span >A popular tikToker can become a member of the affiliate program and receive deductions from going to the page or selling the advertised product. The blogger is required to put the right link under the video and motivate the audience to follow it. These methods of promotion are actively used by traffic arbitrators.</span></p>\n<p><span >Typically, such a scheme works as follows: an interesting video is posted in TikTok, but in an incomplete form, under the video, there is a link to another social network (YouTube or Instagram) and from there, there is a redirect to an affiliate link (either in the profile header or in the story). The application has proven itself in partnerships with offers for clothing, cosmetics, and products in general for a young audience, as well as for the games and entertainment industry.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span >Attracting customers to the business</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span >TikTok works great as an additional advertising channel for attracting customers to online and offline businesses. The best performance so far in the niches voiced in the paragraph above. The specifics of the audience are affected, the products “for the youth audience” most likely “enter”.</span></p>\n<p><span >In the application, you can get wide coverage with the help of a catchy viral video. However, there are limitations: you cannot configure an exact target by parameters, for example, by geolocation.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span >TikTok manager</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span >The demand for promotion in TikTok has thrown the work of SMM-managers. The new social network requires new skills, mainly related to the preparation of video content. Most often, the tasks of a tiker manager include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span >promotion strategy planning,</span></em></li>\n<li><em><span >scripting videos,</span></em></li>\n<li><em><span >terms of reference for photographers and videographers,</span></em></li>\n<li><em><span >account promotion</span></em></li>\n<li><em><span >communication and engagement of the audience, activity planning,</span></em></li>\n<li><em><span >communication with brands and customers for advertising.</span></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span >Conclusion:</span></strong><span > TikTok enters everyday life with huge turns and is gaining popularity. If you spend time recording videos, it’s just silly not to take advantage of monetization opportunities. It is important to remember some of the limitations that the new social network imposes:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span >you need to prepare for the difficulties and not abandon the work with accounts in other popular social networks. Reason: TikTok does not yet allow direct links to anything other than its social networks;</span></li>\n<li><span >age restrictions: earning in Tik-Tok is officially possible only from the age of 18 or with the consent of the parents.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p> Also read: <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-make-money-online-using-publisuitescom.html\">How to make moeny online using Publisuite</a></p>",

However, there are ways to protect yourself. </span><strong><span >VPN (Virtual Private Network) service</span></strong><span > is a great way to provide a secure online network connection. The VPN also allows you to protect your browsing history and access to content that is blocked or limited at the regional level.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1eb9043a90\"><strong><em><span >In this article, we will consider the TOP-3 of the best VPN services in 2020! first, you need to understand what does a VPN does?. So let's go!</span></em></strong></h3>\n<p><span >Each of your devices (computer, smartphone, tablet, etc.) has its unique IP address, which tells the services who you are, what you are doing and where you are. </span><strong><span >A VPN is located between your device and the Internet service provider (ISP).</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span >When a user logs on to the network, the</span></strong><span > VPN \"spoofs\" the device’s IP address. Everything that you do on the network, first goes through a VPN, then to the router - as a result, your router (and everything that is outside of your device) thinks that you have a </span><strong><span >different identity.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span >A VPN is very useful</span></strong><span > when you plan to connect to the Internet through an insecure connection (a network that does not ask for your password), for example, in a cafe, because it stores all kinds of information about you </span><strong><span >(for example, the history of visited pages and any data you transmit) .</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span >A VPN even has other features,</span></strong><span > such as access to content, which may be limited geographically, as it allows you to view the contents of web pages as if you are in another place (city, country, continent).</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1eb9043a91\"><span >How to choose the right VPN</span></h2>\n<p><span >If you have chosen a free VPN, it’s simple enough to start working with it: just select a VPN service, register on the website of the developer company and download the client.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span >Here are a few features to consider when choosing a VPN.</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span >Many servers:</span></strong><span > the more servers the VPN service has, the higher the connection speed and, as a rule, you will have more options for connecting to the selected country. This means that you most likely will not have to deal with buffering problems.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span >Multi-device connectivity:</span></strong><span >  if you need to connect more than one device to VPN simultaneously, you need more power. </span><strong><span >The best VPNs</span></strong><span > allow you to connect up to 5 devices at the same time, if not more.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span >Ease of use:</span></strong><span >  for beginners in a VPN, it’s important to have a clean and well-defined interface, as well as easy access to customer support. For </span><strong><span >experienced users, an</span></strong><span > application that is customizable and allows you to work with additional functions, such as a network switch, data compression (for mobile devices) and automatic HTTPS redirection, will be convenient.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span >Great security and no registration. </span></strong><span > Good VPN services will not track, register or sell your personal information - for example, which websites you visited. They also guarantee that they protect you with strong encryption (256-bit AES) and regular security checks - the </span><strong><span >most important criterion when choosing a VPN in 2020!</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1eb9043a92\"><strong><span >To make life easier for my readers, I picked up TOP-3 of the best free VPN services in 2020 . You can not worry, they are completely safe!</span></strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1eb907tlp8\"><em>ExpressVPN</em> - the<em> best in my opinion</em></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em><span >ExpressVPN </span></em></strong><span >is my choice of the fastest and most powerful VPN service. It is great for getting through any blocked websites and protecting your computer.</span></p>\n<p><span >In its arsenal, the service has more than 30,000 IP addresses, 160 server locations in 94 countries and more than 3,000 available servers. It is also backed by a strict privacy policy, </span><strong><span >available without registration</span></strong><span > , so you can continue </span><strong><span >to surf with peace of mind.</span></strong></p>\n<p><span >Even more impressive is the fact that the service is available on a wide variety of platforms: </span><strong><span >Mac, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS.</span></strong></p>\n<p><span >Want your smart TVs, routers and game consoles to be </span><strong><span >protected by VPN</span></strong><span >?

Its free access is limited to 500 MB per month, and if you need more, the cheapest subscription option starts at $ 4.95 per month, giving you unlimited secure access to up to 5 devices and priority customer service.</span></p>\n<p><span >Even though the nice graphic design makes the service fun and affordable, </span><strong><span >Tunnelbear shines with</span></strong><span > its incredibly amazing privacy policy. He will never register or sell your activity history on the Internet, and will also conduct independent annual service audits </span><strong><span >- something you will not see in most other VPNs.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span >Tunnelbear is</span></strong><span > a simpler and less powerful VPN service, but it is a great option for beginners and those who don’t care about the many settings and advanced features. It has only about 22 server seats and 1800 servers, so it is comfortable for working in a cafe, but probably not ideal for active users.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span >Tunnelbear is</span></strong><span > also available on Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android, and there are browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1eb9075su6\"><strong>IPVanish - the best VPN for connecting multiple devices</strong></h2>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span >If you need to connect multiple devices to a VPN at the same time, </span><strong><span >IPVanish</span></strong><span > ($ 10 / month) is the perfect choice for your purpose. With it, you can connect up to </span><strong><span >10 devices</span></strong><span > at the same time without problems.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span >IPVanish</span></strong><span > has excellent statistics, offering over 1300 anonymous servers in more than 75 locations and 40,000 shared IP addresses. It also has a clear zero-log privacy policy and keeps your data safe with </span><strong><span >256-bit AES encryption.</span></strong></p>\n<p><span >This VPN service has convenient applications for all platforms and devices: </span><strong><span >Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, Chrome OS, Fire TV and WiFi routers.</span></strong></p>\n<p><span >All applications are feature rich and feature options such as </span><strong><span >automatic IP address switching</span></strong><span > . One of the main </span><strong><span >disadvantages of</span></strong><span > IPVanish is that its interface is not as accessible and intuitive as others - therefore, </span><strong><span >it may not be the best choice for novice users.</span></strong></p>\n<p><span >Nevertheless, thanks to round-the-clock customer support, users can quickly get answers to questions when they need it most.</span></p>\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-unblock-blocked-sites-in-android-with-3-best-apps.html\">How to unblock blocked sites in Android </a></p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1eb9043a93\"><span >Final Words:</span></h3>\n<p><span >We reviewed the </span><strong><span >TOP-3 of the best free VPN services in 2020,</span></strong><span > each of which has its advantages and disadvantages, which can be solved, for the most part, by purchasing advanced access or a premium account.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span >You can download and use any of the above VPN services for free.</span></strong></p>",
