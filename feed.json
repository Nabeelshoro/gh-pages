            "content_html": "<p id=\"mcetoc_1dscqp7jm0\"><span >Going on a trip, you need to familiarize yourself with the features of the transport system of the country in which you plan to travel. After all, any situation leading to a violation, the travel plan can result in intangible losses of time and money. Therefore, it is so important to understand all major types of transport, especially such as taxis. Let's try to find out how the taxi service in Spain works.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dscqp7jo1\"><span >Features of a taxi service in Spain.</span></h2>\n<p><span >Spain remains a fairly developed country, in which all EU standards apply. And this means that using the services of a taxi, you have the right to count on compliance with safety standards, a satisfactory condition of the car and the mandatory presence of a meter.</span></p>\n<p><span >The regions of Spain have their specifics, therefore, you will find a more comfortable trip than anywhere else in all EU.</span></p>\n<p><span >An official taxi driver's license is not cheap and you need to go through many bureaucratic procedures to get it, so most Spanish taxi drivers value their workplace and are unlikely to risk their permission for a couple of extra euros.</span></p>\n<p><span >As in most European countries, you can use taxi services in the country by placing an order by phone or using a mobile application or simply by catching it on the street. You can also use the services of cars parked in special parking lots.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dscqp7jo2\"><span >How to order a taxi in Spain</span></h2>\n<p><span >Walking through the streets of Spanish cities, you can see special taxi stands, which can be easily recognized by a blue rectangular sign with a white letter T. You can order a taxi directly at these stops, but certain rules must be observed.</span></p>\n<p><span >Most importantly, always get in the car closest to the exit, as there is a sequence of drivers leaving the parking lot. If parking is not enough for everyone, then people with children, pregnant women, the elderly or disabled are the first to get into them.</span></p>\n<p><span >You can catch a free car, as in most countries of the world, with a wave of your hand, but keep in mind that the driver is not entitled to pick up a passenger within a radius of 50 meters from the parking lot.</span></p>\n<p><span >The fact that the car is free is signaled by a panel with a glowing green light and the sign on the roof of the car. Therefore, it would be most reasonable to book a transfer from the airport to the hotel in advance.</span></p>\n<p><span >Finally, you can always ask to call you a car at the reception of your hotel: however, the reasonableness of the prices of the company whose services you are offered to use will remain solely on the conscience of the hotel staff.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dscqp7jo3\"><span >Taxi rates in Spain</span></h2>\n<p><span >The cost of your trip will depend on many factors, among which the main ones are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span >a region in which the trip takes place;</span></li>\n<li><span >base rate;</span></li>\n<li><span >distance;</span></li>\n<li><span >Times of Day;</span></li>\n<li><span >car class;</span></li>\n<li><span >additional services (child car seat, luggage, etc.).</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span >Sometimes you will have to pay extra for entry into the territory of airports, seaports, railway stations, and some other facilities. The cost of the trip can also increase due to standing in traffic jams.</span></p>\n<p><span >The most popular brand of taxi cars in almost the whole country is the Taxi2Spain, and specilly in <a href=\"https://taxi2spain.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Madrid transfer</a>.</span><span >You can find the additional feature of taxi2spain by visiting their website here taxi2spain.com.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dscqp7jo4\"><span >Useful Tips</span></h2>\n<p><span >As mentioned above, the loss of a license is a nightmare of taxi drivers, so there is no reason to expect obvious fraud from them because only one complaint from a passenger can cost them a career. </span></p>\n<p><span >The best way is to write your destination in large letters on a piece of paper (or a mobile phone screen) in advance and show the driver when landing. If you order a taxi in advance, for example, using the Taxi2Spain service that works perfectly in Spain, then such misunderstandings will not happen at all.</span></p>\n<p><span >Taxi rules in Spain are quite liberal but stricter. You can stop the car on the road almost everywhere except airports, but smoking in the passenger compartment is strictly forbidden, and you have every right to refuse to get into the vehicle passenger compartment while intoxicated.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dscqp7jo5\"><span >Finally</span></h2>\n<p><span >Spain has a developed and reliable taxi system. Using a taxi in Spain is practically safe, as their work is regulated by the state. Taxis operate at rates that are also determined by the state. However, they may vary slightly depending on the region. Besides, it should be noted that at night, as well as on holidays and weekends, tariffs are higher.</span></p>\n<p><span >Keep in mind that not all taxi drivers in Spain speak English, so if you do not know Spanish, you should have a business card or address of your final destination with you. have a nice trip to Spain.</span></p>",

A great interest in vegan cosmetics is primarily among millennials. The reason for the growing interest in this niche was the desire of people to take care of personal health and the environment.</span></p>\n<p><span >Often, ideas about vegan cosmetics are wrong. Many people think that this is only cruelty-free, but not only the ban on testing cosmetic products on animals is important here, but also the complete exclusion from the composition of products of animal origin, for example, beeswax, lanolin, and colored carmine pigment.</span></p>\n<p><span >Another misconception is that vegan foods do not contain synthetic ingredients and chemicals. This is not true.

            "content_html": "The new year 2020 is getting closer. Users of the <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/you-can-try-the-explore-section-in-the-web-version-of-facebook.html\">Facebook</a> Messenger application often send new year's wishes to others, at the moment of the new year Facebook Messenger users feel difficulty to send new year wishes to their friends and relatives. As many as 1.3 billion Messenger users are known to send more messages on New Year's Eve moments, compared to normal days. Not only text messages, but the intensity of sending photos and videos has also increased many times compared to other days. <br> In this article, we will guide you on how to prevent server overload and Message sending failed problem in Facebook Messenger on new year's eve. <br>Well, related to the <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-use-fb-messenger-in-web-browser.html\">Messenger application</a>, Facebook has its way to handle huge traffic of messages sent simultaneously during New Year's Eve, so that the server is not broken, or unable to serve traffic. Knowing this, Messenger technicians also made several steps to handle traffic in the application, ahead of New Year's Eve. Here are some ways that sending messages easily in the Messenger application. <br><br>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Test the server load:</strong> The technicians do server load testing. Before the New Year's Eve, Facebook had already made a simulation by sending several messages that would be received to fellow Messenger users. From here, you can see whether this time the server's ability to handle the traffic flow of the message or not. If you can't, then the allocation of messages that appear to be booming will be transferred to another server. This technique is the same as that done by the Messenger last year. On New Year's Eve 2018, the Messenger team provided an additional server to divert incoming messages to the chat application to prevent overloading on the server.</li>\n<li><strong>Low-Priority Mode:</strong> Facebook has created a mechanism of \"low-priority\" to prevent the booming of messages that could make the server overload due to being sent simultaneously. \"We have set up our system, if the server is dense, the system will start to divert traffic to low-priority mode,\" said Isaac Ahdout, Engineering Manager for Facebook Messenger. This low-priority mechanism will prioritize the messages sent so that they get to other users quickly.  The way this system works is by making priorities, sorting and choosing which features will be \"turned off\" first, to reduce server pressure and burden. For example, the read receipt feature, or a message alert that has been read, will be temporarily deactivated to increase resource allocation for messages to be sent. Then the Messenger technician can also turn off the \"online\" green circle, which helps ease the server load. Another example, Messenger will suspend detailed information about old messages for a while, to ease the server's CPU load. Thus, messages that go in and out will be prioritized first so they can be received quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Scheduler Feature:</strong> Messenger technicians work on a project called \"scheduler\". This scheduler allows the system to unify several messages whose contents are similar. Later, integration with the principle of \"affinity\" will ease the burden on the server, because similar messages will be sent as a group. This process, according to Isacc, will ease the CPU load, because the server receives the message sending request process only once for many collections of messages, rather than having to send it one at a time as a process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null\">How to disable the built-in Browser in the Facebook App in the Android </a></p>\n<p><strong>As a result,</strong> server latency will be reduced by a few milliseconds, so that all messages can be sent smoothly. Facebook servers are still able to handle the swirling billions of users who send messages through the application. <br> However, if the Messenger server is oversupplied due to being crammed with messages simultaneously, then one of the three things will be an alternative solution to ease the burden on the server. Plus, some technicians were on standby in several places to be ready to activate the solution related to problems that might occur ahead of the new year's eve of 2020.</p>",
