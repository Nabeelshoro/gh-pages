            "content_html": "<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Travelers know all about purchasing tickets at the best prices, share how to book accommodation abroad cheaply, and can rent a car with their eyes closed. Today all these services can be selected and paid online without leaving home.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But when the trip has already been planned, the documents have been collected, and the vacation is taken, one mandatory item remains travel insurance.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Most people are sure that travel insurance is issued only with a travel agent or directly at the branch of the insurance company. They postpone registration until the last and then remember this already at the passport control of the airport upon arrival when the kind uncle of the border guard sends them on the return flight.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As a result, the vacation is ruined, the trip ends before it even starts, and the bookings are burned out along with the money. But this could have been avoided if everyone knew that travel insurance can be obtained online.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Getting travel insurance is easier than ordering pizza</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The future has arrived. You no longer need to rush to the office during a work break to spend lunchtime queuing up to see an insurance agent. You do not need to pay him a commission for the fact that he incorrectly enters your passport data into the system. Online travel insurance is issued by the client independently and quickly. To do this, you need to have:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Internet connection;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>data of the foreign passport of the person who needs to be insured;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>bank card for payment;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>e-mail to which the policy will be sent.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">At the same time, do not lose sight of an important point: the reliability of an insurance company is an important factor on which the quality of services and the speed of reimbursement of expenses in the event of an insured event depend.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What determines the cost of \"standard\" insurance?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Standard travel insurance ensures the provision of timely and quality medical care (ambulance, inpatient, outpatient, and emergency dental), as well as additional services related to the provision of this assistance (transport and communication services).</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The price of a travel policy depends primarily on the sum insured, which is determined by the destination. Also, the cost of standard travel insurance depends on the duration of the planned trip and the selected service package.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">For example, the minimum program does not provide for emergency dental care, and inpatient treatment covers 10% of the insured amount per case.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can arrange a suitable insurance program, the conditions of which will correspond to your vacation. We can calculate insurance for those traveling abroad for all companies, choose the options you need, arrange everything in 5 minutes, and receive ready-made insurance by e-mail.</span></p>\n<p>Also read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/3-easy-steps-to-find-the-best-software-developer-for-your-business.html\">3 easy way to find the best software developer </a></li>\n</ul>",

            "content_html": "<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Whether you are hiring a team for a new project or looking to expand your current one, finding the right software developer for your business can be a journey. Recent research shows that hiring talent is the second most important problem in software development or online casino development. The reason is twofold.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">On the one hand, the demand for software engineers exceeds the current supply of skilled labor. More and more companies are turning to technology to digitally transform, improve customer service, or leverage better business tools. And while the number of software engineers is also growing, estimated to reach 28.7 million in 2024, there is still a shortage of the best talent, making it difficult to find a suitable and affordable candidate for businesses.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Second, talented engineers are difficult to spot and evaluate at the same time. Their technical savvy is not the only criterion to consider when choosing. Soft skills of a programmer are just as important, and ticking a few check boxes on a scorecard doesn't provide too much valuable insight into a developer's personality and social skills.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So where do you start? While there is no magic formula for finding the best software developer, there are several steps you can take to improve your chances of finding a top-notch developer for your business.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Start with \"Why\"</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The quality of your software product largely depends on the skills of the developers who create it. To ensure the best fit between the needs of your business and the software engineer, it is important to define for yourself the nature and complexity of the project, as well as your expectations for the developer you want to hire.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If this is a one-off small project with clear responsibilities and tasks, you will most likely want to partner with a freelancer on a one-off basis. On the other hand, if you intend to develop a more complex custom software product that requires a long-term commitment, then hiring a full-time software engineer may be more appropriate.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Having clarity about the scope, duration, complexity of the project, and technical and human resource requirements can, in turn, bring greater clarity to your resource needs.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\"Let the hunger games begin\"</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Once you have decided what type of developer you need, you can proceed with the actual search. Considering the purpose of the project, financial resources, and the urgency of hiring, there are several strategies to choose from when looking for engineering candidates.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Referrals. The most effective way to find the best software engineers is through your personal and professional networks. Refer to the connectors on your network for developer recommendations that may match your criteria. Chances are, you'll find a highly skilled software engineer who also fits a good culture much faster because you'll get referrals from a similar circle. It is also a low hanging fruit because you are reaching out to a network of which you are already a part.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Internet communities. There are several platforms that are great for finding experienced software engineers.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can post a list of vacancies and rate candidates as they come, or you can search and in advance contact developers who match your criteria.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">On the more specialized front, there are platforms like this that attract the best talent from the software development market, increasing your chances of finding a highly qualified developer for your project.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Other valuable resources are software developer communities such as Quora or the Git Hub, where developers share their know-how or technical skills with fellow engineers. Gaining insight into how a software engineer solves a technical problem, expresses his opinion, or analyzes code quality will help you identify opportunities to find the right candidate for your business through better screening.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Conferences / Bootcamps / Hackathons. You can find software engineers passionate about what they do at these types of events that want to get involved in the community, stay ahead of industry trends, and create great professional relationships. These are developers who are not only interested in improving their technical skills but also looking to improve their interpersonal skills. These meetings allow you to go directly to the candidate you are interested in and start a conversation that will help you understand if a software engineer might be the right fit.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Do not shy away from careful assessment</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The software engineer should be assessed on both his technical acumen and his interpersonal skills.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A high-profile software developer must have experience with various programming languages ââand software tools, develop versatility, and a willingness to constantly learn and adapt to new technologies, which is very important for software development. However, a technical assessment should cover more than just interviewing a candidate for a specific technology. You want to understand their ability to creatively solve problems and navigate complex concepts by assessing their programming skills. This will go a long way in the long run and ultimately make your software project stand out and add value.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The developer's attitude is just as important as the skill set. In a software project where teamwork contributes to progress, communication skills, both written and oral, are essential for a smooth process. The chemistry between team members is also an important aspect of creating a culture of collaboration.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Software engineers often work in a dynamic environment, always balancing stakeholder needs, technical details, and best practices under pressure. While technological know-how is critical for any software developer to get their jobs done, it takes much more to succeed. Openness, willingness to improve, enthusiasm, versatility, and self-improvement are just a few of the qualities that distinguish high-profile software developers.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">While the process of finding a top-notch software engineer is challenging, having access to a top-notch developer who can help you create a great product is invaluable. Using the strategies above, there is no doubt that you will be a couple of steps closer to the next ideal candidate to get started with your ambitious project.</span></p>\n<p>Next reading:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/5-benefits-of-getting-managed-web-hosting.html\">5 benefits of getting managed web hosting </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/10-tools-to-help-concentrate-while-working-from-home.html\">10 tools to help concentrate while working from home</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/what-does-life-insurance-do-for-a-car-loan.html\">What does life insurance do for a car loan </a></li>\n</ul>",

            "content_html": "<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As Car loans are one of the most popular types of loans. However, when completing such a procedure, in addition to standard banking requirements, some conditions must be met. One of them is car <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/insurance-tips/\">insurance</a>, the second is life and health insurance with a car loan. This is an additional requirement of banks to provide guarantees of timely repayment of all debts under any circumstances, even if the lender has serious health problems.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This trend is becoming more widespread in banking practice. According to law, life insurance when buying a vehicle in installments is not a prerequisite. However, in reality, getting a car loan without life insurance is becoming more and more difficult.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is the difference between this type of insurance and traditional insurance? In this case, the insurance contract is drawn up once for the entire duration of the credit contract. It does not need to be renewed once a year until the car loan is paid off.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What does life insurance do for a car loan?</span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The right to fully or partially repay the debt under the loan agreement in the event of unforeseen health situations (complete or partial disability or death of the client);</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Protection of the material interests of not only the insured person, but also close relatives (especially if the borrowed person is the only breadwinner in the family);</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In the event of early repayment of the loan debt, the life insurance policy continues for the period for which it was concluded.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Life insurance increases the likelihood that a financial institution will issue a loan. In some banks, the absence of such a policy from a potential client is a reason for refusing to issue a loan, because working with problem debts significantly reduces the bank's profit. In this case, the credit manager has every right not to sign the client's application, without even explaining the reasons for the negative answer.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Life insurance is the confidence that the client will return the funds in full and within the period specified in the contract. On the Internet, you can find a lot of information on how to opt out of life insurance for a car loan. If a citizen is firmly confident in his material capabilities and is convinced that he does not need such a service, he has every right to refuse insurance. To do this, you need to fill out the appropriate application form to the bank. After that, the manager will consider it and make a decision.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You need to be ready to refuse to issue a loan or a loan on less favorable terms with higher interest rates. Thus, car insurance insurance in practice is not an additional cost for the client, but, on the contrary, serves as the basis for reducing the cost of the loan. This is a common practice in banking. The financial institution raises the rate when the risk increases and lowers it when the threats of non-payment diminish.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The cost of the policy for a car loan</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The amount of premiums for life insurance for car loans depends on the size of the loan. However, as a rule, it is no more than 0.1%.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">At the same time, both parties to the transaction: both the bank and the borrower will remain in the black. The first will receive compensation in the amount of the outstanding loan balance, the second will remain the full owner of the car.</span></p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How does customer protection work?</span></h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Suppose that an insured event occurs, as a result of which the citizen has lost his health and, as a result, will not be able to fulfill his professional duties, receive income and pay off the loan debt. In this case, the insurance organization pays the bank the remaining amount of the debt under the loan agreement, protecting the interests of its client. In this case, the vehicle taken on credit remains in the possession of the borrower.</span></p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Final Words</span></h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Life and health insurance for a car loan is not a prerequisite. However, this service should not be neglected, because it is beneficial not only to the bank, but also to the borrower. Having such insurance on hand, you can count on a positive answer to the issuance of a loan, on the one hand, on the other hand, it will serve as reliable protection for the payment of all financial obligations to the bank. By purchasing a life insurance program, you maintain your financial independence and stability.</span></p>\n<p>Also read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-does-health-insurance-work.html\">How does health insurance works</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/why-do-i-need-travel-insurance.html\">Why do I need travel insurance </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/small-and-medium-business-insurance.html\">Small and meduium Business Insurance </a></li>\n</ul>",

It is also better not to fill the hard disk so that the system does not slow down.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In general, there are 3 options for storing files: burn to DVDs, store in the cloud, or purchase an external hard drive.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I will say right away: you should not save the distributions of the programs, because the programs are changing, updated and it is better to download them again from the Internet. Now the time has passed when the programs were stored for several years.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Let's look at each case</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">1. Burning to DVD</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Â is a cheap option, but inconvenient because when you need something, you will need to search for a disc. Also, the disc is easily damaged and scratched, so the reliability is not very good here. The good thing about this method is that it is very inexpensive. And perhaps that's all.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">2. Store in the cloud.Â </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Many cloud services give you disk space for a price. There are two disadvantages here: a constant subscription fee, as well as the risk that the disk on the server will simply burn out.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">And in the contract for such services, it is written in black and white that the organization is not responsible for failures in work. And of course, you need a powerful Internet channel to upload and download your wealth, and your account can be broken and all your files can become public. In the cloud, I store those files that I need constant access from different devices. It is very convenient!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">3. The best way</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Â is an external HDD hard drive. In my opinion, the most reliable. How to choose it? There are two factors here: capacity and reviews. I always choose according to reviews and try to take those models that have already received the proper number of ratings from real users (I don't make new models, I take from a year).</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You should not buy a 2 terabyte disk at once, it is better to buy two disks per terabyte or 500 gigabytes each. One to use as a backup. After all, the more places where information will be recorded, the more likely it will be saved. The external drive is easily connected via USB, and in the \"This PC\" section it appears as a regular hard drive.</span></p>\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-connect-airpods-to-android.html\">How to connect AirPods to Android </a></p>",

Headsets from various manufacturers are available for sale, but AirPods are the most popular. Because the manufacturer of these headphones is Apple, many people have an understandable question: how to connect AirPods to Android. It's very simple, you don't even have to install additional applications and perform complex actions!</span></strong></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How to connect AirPods to Android phones?</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is necessary to make a reservation that AirPods are ordinary wireless headphones that connect to a device via Bluetooth. And here it doesn't matter what operating system is installed on your smartphone or tablet. So it is possible to pair the Apple headset with an Android phone and through the standard settings options. We have compiled step-by-step instructions, so we recommend that you familiarize yourself with it:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Open the smart phone settings.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Go to the \"Bluetooth\" section and move the slider to the right next to the corresponding item. You can also activate the option through the quick access shutter by opening it, and then clicking on the icon with the logo of the desired mode.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We open the case where the AirPods themselves are located. Note that before starting pairing, the headphones must be returned to the case if you removed them from there before.Â </span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">On the back of the case, we find an almost invisible button. It is easy to feel it. We hold it down, and then we wait a few seconds until the white or green indicator lights up. It all depends on what generation your headset is.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We return to the phone, or rather to the \"Bluetooth\" tab. Refreshing the page and see that the name of Apple headphones has appeared on the list with available devices. Click on it to perform pairing. If the connection is made for the first time, then in the window that appears, you will need to select \"Accept\".</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">And that's it, now you can listen to music through AirPods connected to your Android smartphone. Here the principle of action is standard - click on the desired track and adjust the volume. You can also chat on the phone, record voice messages, and use other features of the wireless headset. But several nuances should be paid attention to.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Features of using AirPods with Android</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As you know, AirPods are primarily designed for Apple smartphones, so Android phone owners may face certain restrictions. Firstly, the Siri voice assistant will be completely inaccessible, but you can use the rest of the assistants, but only after additional configuration.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Secondly, if you take the earpiece out of your ear, the melody will continue to play. To stop a track, you need to manually open the player on your smartphone, and then press the pause button. But this flaw can be fixed by installing the AndroPods app. It allows you to customize the wireless headset in detail, including turning on the display of the charge in the status bar and activating some gestures.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So, we took a quick look at how to connect AirPods to Android correctly. As practice shows, it is almost always possible to pair with headphones the first time. If you still have additional questions, then ask them in the comments. We will try to answer them and help you solve the problem!</span></p>\n<p>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/5-reasons-to-move-from-word-to-google-docs.html\">5 reason to move from Word to Google Doc</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In this article, I have collected 5 reasons that, will make you think about using Google Doc.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Google Docs is free</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You need to compare Google Dox not even with Word (a program for a computer), but with the Office 365 service. As you know, there the subscription is paid monthly or for a year.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You don't have to pay anything at Google Doc. Except when there are a lot of files on your Disk. Then you will have to buy additional space. But filling 15 GB of free space with texts is a difficult problem, you are unlikely to succeed.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Google Docs is easy to use through a browser</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To be fair, I note that Microsoft Office now has an online editor. If you have a Microsoft account, you can safely edit your texts online.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But the functionality of Microsoft's online editor will unpleasantly surprise fans of a text editor for the Word computer. Many features have been removed. Others work with limitations.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In Google Dox, the functionality is the same everywhere: on a computer, on a phone, on a tablet. You can launch a regular browser and use the service without installing any programs.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Google Docs is more convenient for group work</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Often in life, you need to discuss a text with colleagues or friends. Sending it by message. If the text is more than three paragraphs, then how will the interlocutor tell you his thoughts on its content?</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Google Docs comes to the rescue. It is not necessary that all participants in the discussion have a Google account. Email from other operators will do just as well.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can log in without authorization and leave comments in the document anonymously. Unless, of course, you will not be stopped by the fact that you will be introduced to the discussion participants.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Comments can be discussed. Your answer will be recorded below, the history of your correspondence will be saved.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Through Google Docs, it turned out to be convenient to agree on plans and standards for the interaction of projects in which more than two parties are involved. It came in handy for me at work.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Google Docs is handy on your phone</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I never thought that texts on the phone could be relatively convenient to edit. But it turned out that this is possible. Not only without functionality limitations, but even with a couple of new, in comparison with a computer editor, chips. For example, mobile dox is able to add words, you can dictate text. The mobile keyboard also helps.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">By the way, you can also dictate text on a computer using Ctrl-Shift-S.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is clear that all mobile platforms are supported: existing (Google and Apple) and any new ones (via a web browser that is in any operating system).</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Google Docs is growing faster</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The rapid development of Google's text editor is understandable. The functionality has not yet caught up with Word, so new features appear frequently. For example, text comparison has recently appeared.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">And here's another trick that hasn't appeared in paid Word for decades. If you typed the text in the wrong layout, in Google Docs you can fix it with one mouse button.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In order to work with text without an Internet connection, open offline access to it.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The file will update in the cloud the next time you connect to the network.</span></p>\n<p>Also read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-play-minecraft-on-your-phone.html\">How to play Minecraft on your phone</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-enable-miracast-on-android.html\">How to enable Miracast on Android</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/5-benefits-of-getting-managed-web-hosting.html\">5 benefits of getting managed web hosting</a></li>\n</ul>",

After paying for the purchase, the game will be installed automatically.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Features:</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The mobile version of the game supports not an only single-player mode but also playing on the server. You can also use various console commands, install your favorite free updates to diversify the gameplay.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The mobile version of the game is less resource-demanding than the computer version. Despite this, in terms of its capabilities, it is not inferior in anything. The only thing you have to get used to is management. In other words, experienced players are not inconvenienced by this.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The movement is controlled by the thumb of the left hand; it is more convenient to control the inventory with two hands.
