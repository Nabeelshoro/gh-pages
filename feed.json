However, when completing such a procedure, in addition to standard banking requirements, some conditions must be met. One of them is car <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/insurance-tips/\">insurance</a>, the second is life and health insurance with a car loan. This is an additional requirement of banks to provide guarantees of timely repayment of all debts under any circumstances, even if the lender has serious health problems.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This trend is becoming more widespread in banking practice. According to law, life insurance when buying a vehicle in installments is not a prerequisite. However, in reality, getting a car loan without life insurance is becoming more and more difficult.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is the difference between this type of insurance and traditional insurance? In this case, the insurance contract is drawn up once for the entire duration of the credit contract. It does not need to be renewed once a year until the car loan is paid off.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What does life insurance do for a car loan?</span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The right to fully or partially repay the debt under the loan agreement in the event of unforeseen health situations (complete or partial disability or death of the client);</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Protection of the material interests of not only the insured person, but also close relatives (especially if the borrowed person is the only breadwinner in the family);</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In the event of early repayment of the loan debt, the life insurance policy continues for the period for which it was concluded.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Life insurance increases the likelihood that a financial institution will issue a loan. In some banks, the absence of such a policy from a potential client is a reason for refusing to issue a loan, because working with problem debts significantly reduces the bank's profit. In this case, the credit manager has every right not to sign the client's application, without even explaining the reasons for the negative answer.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Life insurance is the confidence that the client will return the funds in full and within the period specified in the contract. On the Internet, you can find a lot of information on how to opt out of life insurance for a car loan. If a citizen is firmly confident in his material capabilities and is convinced that he does not need such a service, he has every right to refuse insurance. To do this, you need to fill out the appropriate application form to the bank. After that, the manager will consider it and make a decision.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You need to be ready to refuse to issue a loan or a loan on less favorable terms with higher interest rates. Thus, car insurance insurance in practice is not an additional cost for the client, but, on the contrary, serves as the basis for reducing the cost of the loan. This is a common practice in banking. The financial institution raises the rate when the risk increases and lowers it when the threats of non-payment diminish.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The cost of the policy for a car loan</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The amount of premiums for life insurance for car loans depends on the size of the loan. However, as a rule, it is no more than 0.1%.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">At the same time, both parties to the transaction: both the bank and the borrower will remain in the black. The first will receive compensation in the amount of the outstanding loan balance, the second will remain the full owner of the car.</span></p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How does customer protection work?</span></h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Suppose that an insured event occurs, as a result of which the citizen has lost his health and, as a result, will not be able to fulfill his professional duties, receive income and pay off the loan debt. In this case, the insurance organization pays the bank the remaining amount of the debt under the loan agreement, protecting the interests of its client. In this case, the vehicle taken on credit remains in the possession of the borrower.</span></p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Final Words</span></h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Life and health insurance for a car loan is not a prerequisite.

This feature is ideal for transferring chats to your new device:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Before you \"move\" to a new phone, open the WhatsApp application, and tap on the three dots icon.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Go to Settings&gt; Conversations&gt; Chat Backup.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In the next window, you can manually select individual chats or configure the creation of a backup copy of conversations automatically at any frequency.

It is also better not to fill the hard disk so that the system does not slow down.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In general, there are 3 options for storing files: burn to DVDs, store in the cloud, or purchase an external hard drive.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I will say right away: you should not save the distributions of the programs, because the programs are changing, updated and it is better to download them again from the Internet. Now the time has passed when the programs were stored for several years.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Let's look at each case</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">1. Burning to DVD</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> is a cheap option, but inconvenient because when you need something, you will need to search for a disc. Also, the disc is easily damaged and scratched, so the reliability is not very good here. The good thing about this method is that it is very inexpensive. And perhaps that's all.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">2. Store in the cloud. </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Many cloud services give you disk space for a price. There are two disadvantages here: a constant subscription fee, as well as the risk that the disk on the server will simply burn out.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">And in the contract for such services, it is written in black and white that the organization is not responsible for failures in work. And of course, you need a powerful Internet channel to upload and download your wealth, and your account can be broken and all your files can become public. In the cloud, I store those files that I need constant access from different devices. It is very convenient!</span></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">3. The best way</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> is an external HDD hard drive. In my opinion, the most reliable. How to choose it? There are two factors here: capacity and reviews. I always choose according to reviews and try to take those models that have already received the proper number of ratings from real users (I don't make new models, I take from a year).</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You should not buy a 2 terabyte disk at once, it is better to buy two disks per terabyte or 500 gigabytes each. One to use as a backup. After all, the more places where information will be recorded, the more likely it will be saved. The external drive is easily connected via USB, and in the \"This PC\" section it appears as a regular hard drive.</span></p>\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-connect-airpods-to-android.html\">How to connect AirPods to Android </a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Almost every person uses wireless headphones now, as it is convenient. For example, without additional cables, you can listen to music or podcasts while walking, cycling, or just jogging. Headsets from various manufacturers are available for sale, but AirPods are the most popular. Because the manufacturer of these headphones is Apple, many people have an understandable question: how to connect AirPods to Android. It's very simple, you don't even have to install additional applications and perform complex actions!</span></strong></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How to connect AirPods to Android phones?</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is necessary to make a reservation that AirPods are ordinary wireless headphones that connect to a device via Bluetooth. And here it doesn't matter what operating system is installed on your smartphone or tablet. So it is possible to pair the Apple headset with an Android phone and through the standard settings options. We have compiled step-by-step instructions, so we recommend that you familiarize yourself with it:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Open the smart phone settings.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Go to the \"Bluetooth\" section and move the slider to the right next to the corresponding item. You can also activate the option through the quick access shutter by opening it, and then clicking on the icon with the logo of the desired mode.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We open the case where the AirPods themselves are located. Note that before starting pairing, the headphones must be returned to the case if you removed them from there before. </span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">On the back of the case, we find an almost invisible button. It is easy to feel it. We hold it down, and then we wait a few seconds until the white or green indicator lights up. It all depends on what generation your headset is.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We return to the phone, or rather to the \"Bluetooth\" tab. Refreshing the page and see that the name of Apple headphones has appeared on the list with available devices. Click on it to perform pairing. If the connection is made for the first time, then in the window that appears, you will need to select \"Accept\".</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">And that's it, now you can listen to music through AirPods connected to your Android smartphone. Here the principle of action is standard - click on the desired track and adjust the volume. You can also chat on the phone, record voice messages, and use other features of the wireless headset. But several nuances should be paid attention to.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Features of using AirPods with Android</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As you know, AirPods are primarily designed for Apple smartphones, so Android phone owners may face certain restrictions. Firstly, the Siri voice assistant will be completely inaccessible, but you can use the rest of the assistants, but only after additional configuration.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Secondly, if you take the earpiece out of your ear, the melody will continue to play. To stop a track, you need to manually open the player on your smartphone, and then press the pause button. But this flaw can be fixed by installing the AndroPods app. It allows you to customize the wireless headset in detail, including turning on the display of the charge in the status bar and activating some gestures.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So, we took a quick look at how to connect AirPods to Android correctly. As practice shows, it is almost always possible to pair with headphones the first time. If you still have additional questions, then ask them in the comments. We will try to answer them and help you solve the problem!</span></p>\n<p>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/5-reasons-to-move-from-word-to-google-docs.html\">5 reason to move from Word to Google Doc</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In this article, I have collected 5 reasons that, will make you think about using Google Doc.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Google Docs is free</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You need to compare Google Dox not even with Word (a program for a computer), but with the Office 365 service. As you know, there the subscription is paid monthly or for a year.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You don't have to pay anything at Google Doc. Except when there are a lot of files on your Disk. Then you will have to buy additional space. But filling 15 GB of free space with texts is a difficult problem, you are unlikely to succeed.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Google Docs is easy to use through a browser</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To be fair, I note that Microsoft Office now has an online editor. If you have a Microsoft account, you can safely edit your texts online.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But the functionality of Microsoft's online editor will unpleasantly surprise fans of a text editor for the Word computer. Many features have been removed. Others work with limitations.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In Google Dox, the functionality is the same everywhere: on a computer, on a phone, on a tablet. You can launch a regular browser and use the service without installing any programs.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Google Docs is more convenient for group work</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Often in life, you need to discuss a text with colleagues or friends. Sending it by message. If the text is more than three paragraphs, then how will the interlocutor tell you his thoughts on its content?</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Google Docs comes to the rescue. It is not necessary that all participants in the discussion have a Google account. Email from other operators will do just as well.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can log in without authorization and leave comments in the document anonymously. Unless, of course, you will not be stopped by the fact that you will be introduced to the discussion participants.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Comments can be discussed. Your answer will be recorded below, the history of your correspondence will be saved.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Through Google Docs, it turned out to be convenient to agree on plans and standards for the interaction of projects in which more than two parties are involved. It came in handy for me at work.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Google Docs is handy on your phone</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I never thought that texts on the phone could be relatively convenient to edit. But it turned out that this is possible. Not only without functionality limitations, but even with a couple of new, in comparison with a computer editor, chips. For example, mobile dox is able to add words, you can dictate text. The mobile keyboard also helps.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">By the way, you can also dictate text on a computer using Ctrl-Shift-S.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is clear that all mobile platforms are supported: existing (Google and Apple) and any new ones (via a web browser that is in any operating system).</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Google Docs is growing faster</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The rapid development of Google's text editor is understandable. The functionality has not yet caught up with Word, so new features appear frequently. For example, text comparison has recently appeared.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">And here's another trick that hasn't appeared in paid Word for decades. If you typed the text in the wrong layout, in Google Docs you can fix it with one mouse button.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In order to work with text without an Internet connection, open offline access to it.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The file will update in the cloud the next time you connect to the network.</span></p>\n<p>Also read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-play-minecraft-on-your-phone.html\">How to play Minecraft on your phone</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-enable-miracast-on-android.html\">How to enable Miracast on Android</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/5-benefits-of-getting-managed-web-hosting.html\">5 benefits of getting managed web hosting</a></li>\n</ul>",

That is, you can watch TV shows or <a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/5-best-smartphone-to-optimize-your-gaming-experience.html\">play games on the large display</a>.</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How to enable Miracast on Android?</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So, in this section, we proceed to its activation on the smartphone. Note that the broadcast is only available to users of smartphones with Android 4.2 and higher. Unfortunately, outdated phones do not allow image and video transmission to the TV screen. So, if you have an updated smartphone, you can enable Miracast, follow these steps:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Open the settings.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Go to the \"Connection and Sharing\" section.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Go to the \"Broadcast\" tab.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Next to the item \"Broadcast\", move the slider to the right to activate the mode.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Now turn on Wi-Fi on the TV and go to the menu with a connection to the phone. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you having difficulty finding this option, comment bellow your SmartTv Model and manufacturer name I will suggest the ways of option, or I also recommend that you read the manufacturer's instructions.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Find the TV model in the list on the smartphone and click on it.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Wait for the smartphone to connect to the TV.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can also use the \"Wireless Display\" option. It practically does not differ from the previous version and allows you to display the image from the phone to a computer monitor or TV. Here's how to enable it in the settings:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Open the \"Connection and Sharing\" tab.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Go to the \"Wireless Display\" section.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Next to the item of the same name, move the slider to the right.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In the list, we find the model of your TV or monitor and connect.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">And if your phone cannot start screen broadcasting through the settings, then you can install the Miracast application from the Play Store. After the installation is complete, open the utility, click on the \"Connect\" button and select the name of the TV or monitor from the list.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So now you know how to enable Miracast on Android. All options and control can be found in the settings of the smartphone, so there shouldn't be any problems. And if you still have questions, be sure to write them in the comments.

            "content_html": "<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you are planning to start your online career, surely you need a website to show your products. All online businesses rely on website hosting to keep them online and connected to the world. There was a time when more people preferred to take full responsibility for their online servers. But today's world is faster and busier. That is why they prefer to purchase managed web hosting. Here I have to guide you on why you should also do the same.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Save on operating expenses</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Many people have the misconception that acquiring managed hosting is more expensive because you also have to pay for the service. You realize how wrong it is only after having experienced it. There are many lower and hidden costs of managing accommodation yourself. You have to invest in a lot of resources, and even then, you won't get the results you expected.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">No need to hire support staff</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It's not just about one person's job. You need database administrators, system administrators, and support staff to ensure that your servers stay online and up and running. A minor problem can cost your business a lot. If you buy managed </span><u><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.thetrickspeak.com/why-wordpress-what-are-the-advantages.html\">WordPress hosting</a>,</span></u><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> you won't have to invest in hiring and retaining a team of professionals.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The service provider will already have the best professionals on the job. They are more experienced in hosting management than you are with many resources you can probably afford.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Safer and more maintained</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Managed hosting service providers use security and seamless maintenance as their unique selling points. Online threats have only increased over time. Some do it for fun and others for ransom. You won't have the resources and personnel to fight an army of haters who are always looking for weaknesses to exploit.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A professional service that manages website hosting for a living would know exactly how to fend off any attack that might come this way. They will keep their hosting optimized and updated to guarantee the best performance. This will take a lot of your worries off your shoulders.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">24 Hours monitoring</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The employees you hire will only work hours before. They will also need casual, medical, and other permits. The hosting requires full-time monitoring to make sure everything continues to run smoothly. This means that you can hire a staff of three different hours with support staff or purchase managed accommodation. The last option is definitely more efficient and cheaper.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">All of these service providers offer </span><u><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">24-hour monitoring</span></u><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. First, they keep everything so well maintained so there is no problem. On top of that, they keep an alert staff on call to predict any potential problems before they happen and resolve them without you noticing.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Get the best out of your backup</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Not keeping a backup of your data is not a smart move in the 21st century. People use backup copies to protect even personal data. So there shouldn't be a question of not keeping your business data backed up. The problem, the backup also requires a safe space and a system that automatically updates the data. Instead of investing more in backups and Shared hosting at the same time, it is more viable to acquire a professional service that can do it for you.</span></p>\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null\">Factors to consider before choosing a web hosting provider </a></p>",
