If so this is for you to earn money from your creative hobbies. Here I will guide you to turn your hobby into a profitable business? Yes! Using the trading platform Etsy, you can create your own shop and sell your crafts throughout the world.</p>
<h2>What Products Should Create To Sell On Etsy</h2>
<ul>
<li>My first advice is “<strong>Do something unique</strong>”. <strong>Etsy</strong> is an area with thousands of unique stores.  <strong>Make your product unique and attractive to come up with something new</strong>. You can look at what competitors are selling? Try to find out the main trends and develop products based on the information received. Here your main task is to create something so new, unique and original, that attracts buyers.</li>
<li><strong>Create things that related to your hobby you like.</strong> Despite what you want, what would your shop was unique and new, it is important to continue working in your product and have a lot of money. The love of your work is reflected in the things that you create, so do what you really like. Here are two tips related to this.</li>
<li><strong>If you have some unique ideas,</strong> create a list of possible things that you would like to create. Place them in, the list based on your level of knowledge before making a final decision.</li>
<li><strong>Here is one important point that,</strong> do not limit you to one category. You are the owner of your store and you can do whatever you like. If you like to do many different things, do a lot of different things. Just be sure that all of your products have a common thread, that your store does not seem disorganized.</li>
<li><strong>Know your customer.</strong> Despite the fact that you are doing something that you like, you should think about getting your things liked not only to you. Examine your target audience and what they are looking for in your product. What is the age range, gender, and occupation of your customers?</li>
<li><strong>Start with few things.</strong> Here is the main mistake most beginners think, they need to have a large number of goods for sale to start trading in the store. You can make many products while waiting for your first sale. Just start trading with a small number of goods.</li>
<li>After some time, you can make your store full of your products, but in the beginning, it is better to focus on the finalization of the construction and design of your product and just home business processes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>At this stage, you have a great opportunity to learn something new and make some changes based on the feedback you receive from your customers.</li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to Presentation.</strong> Packaging is as important as the product itself. If you sell your crafts in high-quality packaging with a nice logo, chances are you will make a good impression on the customer, and it will be your regular customer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tips to create a good user-name to attract more customers.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The main point you should note is to come up with the appropriate user-name. It will embody your personality on Etsy. It will also be part of your name URL nabeelshoro.etsy.com and your brand name URL thetrickspeak.etsy.com. Choose carefully, because it cannot be changed later. Username set out as above should be easy to remember and easy to write that you have no difficulty when you'll share a link to your store to others.</li>
<li>Perhaps you will not always sell the same type of craft, so try not to make a name for your store too specific with your products. If your account was originally vintages, but later you stop sailing vintage products and start selling jewelry, it will mislead people.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changing the account with the buyer to seller.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Etsy automatically assigns all new accounts to the status of "User", so you need to change your account settings to be able to sell their products. Log into your account, go to 'sell' at the top of the page and then "start" on the next page. To complete the process, you just need to enter your credit card number.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How To Setting u Your Shop on Etsy? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up shop. When customers visit your shop on Etsy, their first visit may be at your home page. On this page you can add text, a banner or personal information about your store. Try to make your store more professional.  Attractive Home Store will greatly increase your chances of the sale, so make sure the main page looks professional.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Make a banner with the name of your shop</strong>,</p>
<ul>
<li>which will be located at the top? It must be relevant to the products that you sell. Fill tab "Vendor". Add a small photo and a little information about yourself or your shop. Giving buyers the opportunity to find out who is making these crafts, you make them more loyal to your store.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evaluate your product</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Before you start to sell your crafts, you have to calculate their price. The best way to determine the exact price of its products is to use this equation as like below formula: <span style="color: #ff0000;">Work + materials + cost + profit = x2 = wholesale price retail price</span></li>
<li>Find out the cost of delivery of products to customers location. You have to make a table for customers, which specify the delivery cost for each of the goods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Take quality photos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No matter how wonderful your product is, if the photos are of poor quality, it will not be in demand. Etsy allows adding five photos for a single product, so use them all.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Take photos of your product from different angles.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use natural light to get high-quality images. Photograph your crafts on the street or near an open window. This will convey the true color and texture of your stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pick the right backdrop for your photos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Classic white background suitable for any product, but you can choose any background. Whatever pattern you choose, make sure it attracts the visitor's attention and distracts him from your product.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No need to spend money on expensive camera</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you use the above methods of design, the usual digital camera is what you need. If necessary, use a computer program to edit photos that have to edit the image to your liking and to increase their attractiveness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Give a Detailed Account in Words of the Terms of Service.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is important that you will be responsible when it comes to sales. Make your terms of service available for your store. For example: Do you accept an exchange or refund? Who is responsible if your item arrived damaged by the buyer? Do you have a waiting period before sending?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Add the appropriate Labels/tags. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you show your products for sale, you are given the option to add tags (labels) to describe them. They help when searching through Google or Etsy and direct visitors to your shop. You can add up to 13 tags and make better use of all 13 and not be content with little.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specify the characteristics of the crafts in the tags.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you make jewelry, create tags based on color, material, manufacturing process, style, size, and so on. Include as much specific tags as you can.</li>
</ul>
