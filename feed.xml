                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you want to be a successful employee, you have to make some effort and sacrifice. Because success cannot be bought with money, there is only a good </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">attitude</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> towards everyone. Being a successful employee is everyone's dream, but not everyone can do it.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Usually, successful employees are those who come from people who have never felt great. Those who are constantly thirsty for knowledge and want to learn from others. These are the people who are successful thanks to their persistence and the way they value themselves and others.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you want to be successful, try to change your </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">attitude</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. What should be done, consider the following points.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Have High Tolerance</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Today many people are easily offended by trivial things. Why? Due to a lack of tolerance towards others. People lack tolerance, many people are shunned. Not because he smelled of sweat, but because he was irritable.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Don't expect to be successful if you don't have tolerance.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Have A Good Leadership Spirit</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Everyone has a leadership spirit in him. It's just that the levels sometimes vary. But this is not an excuse, because that leadership spirit can be </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">upgraded</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and trained.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Start to have a good leadership spirit. Because this will be very necessary when you want to be a successful employee. The spirit of leadership does not always have to be because of how many are in the top position (leader/chairman). It could be that when you become an ordinary team member, you use your leadership spirit to embrace your entire team so that you can work as </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">teamwork</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">People who have a good leadership spirit will be highly respected by others. And certainly, more responsibility will be given later.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Passion To Continue Learning</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Successful employees may not be satisfied with the knowledge they already have. Surely they will continue to be excited to learn about new things. Learning not only academically, but what is important is his enthusiasm to learn new things both following his field and outside his field.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Because successful people realize, when they get to the top, a wind will blow them away. If they can't hold back the gust of wind then it will fall. Now what can withstand the wind is science. With knowledge, they can do many things to continue to survive and crawl up.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Especially in this day and age information is very open and quickly conveyed. If there is no high desire to learn, it will be easy to be rolled by the waves of the next generation who are more capable.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Good Communication Skills</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You must also have good communication skills, both verbally and non-verbally. Including how to communicate via digital, such as </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">e-mail</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, social media, etc.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It will all be a reflection of you. When you are wrong in communicating with other people, it will be a bad reflection of you.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So continue to clean up in communicating. Again, in today's technology era, it is very easy for people to communicate, especially through their social media. Even if it's just text on WhatsApp, keep your communication well.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Think Critically</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If there are people who say, ' </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So don't be critical people'</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, they are wrong. It is precisely in this day and age that we must have critical thinking. Critical thinking is positive because we can see another point of view from the information. So it is not easy to </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">eat hoaxes</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and others.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So we don't swallow the information we receive. Will be evaluated first systematically to know whether this is good or bad.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the scope of work, critical thinking can produce solutions to existing problems. People like this are the ones who will be successful.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ability To Establish Relationships</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A person's success cannot be obtained alone. There will be contributions from other people. This is where it is necessary to have the ability to build good relationships with everyone. Especially the people who can make a positive impact.</span></p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A small phone with a great camera and laconic Android 11 of the latest version - this is how you can describe the Google Pixel 4a. Google Pixel of any generation is a real exotic, since we do not even smell of official sales, but people nevertheless get themselves these unusual Google phones.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At first glance, the Google Pixel 4a does not cling to at all: the phone looks simple, the body is made of ordinary plastic. At the same time, for connoisseurs of the Pixel cult, this is a great chance to try Google software without overpaying for "extra" functions. The compact Pixel 4a fits easily into any pocket and weighs nothing - the perfect mobile camera for all occasions.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Specifications</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">OS: Android 11;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 730;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Screen: 5.81 ″, 1080 × 2340, OLED, Gorilla Glass 3, Always-On;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">RAM: 6 GB;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Built-in memory: 128 GB, UFS 2.1;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Front camera: 8 megapixels (f / 2.0);</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Main camera: 12.2 MP (f / 1.7), optical stabilization, video recording 4K 30 fps;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Communications: NFC, eSIM, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 5.0, USB Type-C 3.1;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Protection: fingerprint scanner;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sound: stereo speakers, 3.5 mm;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Battery: 3140 mAh, fast charging 18 W;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dimensions: 144 x 69.4 x 8.2mm;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Weight: 143 g.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Reasonable format</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The phone is small, light, and thin, if you are tired of bulky devices, then this is simply salvation. Although the screen is not that small: 5.81 inches diagonal is quite enough for comfortable viewing of videos or typing.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The display is flat: no bends at the sides, a simple flat surface covered with Gorilla Glass 3, where it is not difficult to attach additional protective glass. The frames are not the thinnest, but nevertheless, the front surface looks neat.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The screen is of normal quality, it does not have any features such as an increased refresh rate, like the OnePlus Nord classmate or a super-durable protective glass. Medium quality oleophobic coating, the picture is bright and does not fade outdoors. The brightness control works well, you can read the screen at night and not overload your eyes.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Great pocket camera</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There is a simple rule in the smartphone market: if you want a phone with a great camera, buy a flagship. But Google has its own opinion on this, the Pixel 4a has a very affordable price of $ 350, while the smartphone is at its best in terms of photo quality.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There are no additional modules like telephoto or ultra-wide angle. Only one single 12-megapixel camera, familiar from old Google smartphones, and all the power of software for image processing.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Impressions from the camera of an inexpensive smartphone remained excellent, the Google Pixel 4a produces a picture of excellent quality, it can be put on a par with flagships. Excellent night mode, fast focusing, except that it takes a little longer to process HDR images than you expect. But the result is worth it.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Not about benchmarks, but about optimization</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The filling is as follows: not the freshest, but a quite vigorous Snapdragon 730, 6 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of its own memory. Of course, there is no memory card slot, like in any other phone in the Pixel line.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The characteristics are common, but the software is well adapted, the vibration response is excellent, so I don't want to let go of the small Pixel. The phone pleased me with its responsiveness and high-speed operation, the interface is smooth, the design is laconic - the inexpensive Pixel 4a left a pleasant feeling.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In theory, a smartphone should receive software updates for at least three years, this time. The second point - at the same time we get all the features of Android, as for more expensive smartphones of the Pixel family. Another thing is that not all the delights of the Google ecosystem are available to us. For example, a voice recorder with a speech transcript function appeared in Pixel backgrounds, it works in real-time with a breakdown by seconds. A journalist's dream! But so far only English is supported.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I like the minimalist design of the menu, there is nothing superfluous, and convenient little things brighten up life. For example, you can enable a responsive row with icons, then application icons will automatically appear on the bottom line of the home screen, depending on your preferences. And how convenient the built-in function for detecting spam calls with the next offer to get a credit card works!</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I got the phone on Android 10, but soon an update to Android 11 arrived. I hope that Google will regularly release patches and there will be no problems with support.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One hand-phone</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you judge the phone by its looks, then you will not experience any emotions from the Pixel 4a. The case is plastic, the feeling of an inexpensive phone is complemented by tight volume control buttons and a loudly clicking power key.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There is no need to choose between body colors, the phone is available only in black. It's a shame there aren't any more fun colors, like light gray, white, or bright yellow, but the Pixel 4a has some great fabric cases. They are very pleasant to the touch, the pattern on the surface is interesting and thus you can refresh a boring look. On the other hand, matte plastic is not a pity: it will not break when dropped, like glass, scratches on it also did not appear in a couple of weeks of use.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Useful functions</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The fingerprint scanner is located at the back, it works without errors, the main thing is not to miss and hit it blindly the first time, but this is already a matter of habit. However, after getting acquainted with the Galaxy S20 Fan Edition, where the sub-screen fingerprint scanner worked just disgusting, I can no longer say that the scanner on the back is bad. At least it works perfectly and doesn't go dumb. But the main thing is that you can confidently use a light smartphone with one hand, without fear of dropping it.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To the delight of fans of wired headphones, the Pixel 4a has a 3.5mm jack on the top for listening to music. The phone has stereo speakers, which are not found in all inexpensive smartphones. The sound is ordinary: the volume is at a good level, but without pleasant features such as deep lows or a sense of volume.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By tradition, the phone has one physical SIM-card, but there is support for eSIM. Payment for purchases via Google Pay is also present, there is NFC in the smartphone.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Autonomy</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The box with the phone contains a powerful 18 W charger, you won't have to spend money on an additional power supply, fast charging is always at hand. The phone does not support wireless charging, which is a pity.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The indicators, according to my feelings, are good: a phone with a small battery can easily withstand a day of active use, giving out about 5.5-6 hours of screen time in total. For comparison, Google Pixel 3 XL works the same for me.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">About Price</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In America, the smartphone costs $ 350 excluding taxes, the Google Pixel 4a has only black color and one memory option: 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In America, the phone's main competitor is the iPhone SE (2020). But there the 128 GB version costs $ 449. If you save up and cut it down to 64 GB, you still have to pay $ 399.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On the side of the iPhone is the Apple ecosystem, more expensive and high-quality materials, as well as a top-end processor, albeit of the last generation. But the Pixel 4a wins in battery life, it has a bigger screen and better photos. But in terms of the feel of the phone in hand, the iPhone SE is, of course, ahead.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For American or European buyers, the Google Pixel 4a turned out to be an interesting proposition. It captivates not with a dry set of characteristics, but with the sensations that add up as you use the smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is inexpensive, while taking great pictures, works quickly, is not overloaded with unnecessary functions, and you don't have to worry about the battery life. At the same time, it is small and easy to use with one hand, there are not enough such smartphones and I want more of them.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But when the trip has already been planned, the documents have been collected, and the vacation is taken, one mandatory item remains travel insurance.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Most people are sure that travel insurance is issued only with a travel agent or directly at the branch of the insurance company. They postpone registration until the last and then remember this already at the passport control of the airport upon arrival when the kind uncle of the border guard sends them on the return flight.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As a result, the vacation is ruined, the trip ends before it even starts, and the bookings are burned out along with the money. But this could have been avoided if everyone knew that travel insurance can be obtained online.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Getting travel insurance is easier than ordering pizza</span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The future has arrived. You no longer need to rush to the office during a work break to spend lunchtime queuing up to see an insurance agent. You do not need to pay him a commission for the fact that he incorrectly enters your passport data into the system. Online travel insurance is issued by the client independently and quickly. To do this, you need to have:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internet connection;</strong></li>
<li><strong>data of the foreign passport of the person who needs to be insured;</strong></li>
<li><strong>bank card for payment;</strong></li>
<li><strong>e-mail to which the policy will be sent.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At the same time, do not lose sight of an important point: the reliability of an insurance company is an important factor on which the quality of services and the speed of reimbursement of expenses in the event of an insured event depend.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What determines the cost of "standard" insurance?</span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Standard travel insurance ensures the provision of timely and quality medical care (ambulance, inpatient, outpatient, and emergency dental), as well as additional services related to the provision of this assistance (transport and communication services).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The price of a travel policy depends primarily on the sum insured, which is determined by the destination. Also, the cost of standard travel insurance depends on the duration of the planned trip and the selected service package.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For example, the minimum program does not provide for emergency dental care, and inpatient treatment covers 10% of the insured amount per case.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You can arrange a suitable insurance program, the conditions of which will correspond to your vacation. We can calculate insurance for those traveling abroad for all companies, choose the options you need, arrange everything in 5 minutes, and receive ready-made insurance by e-mail.</span></p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Whether you are hiring a team for a new project or looking to expand your current one, finding the right software developer for your business can be a journey. Recent research shows that hiring talent is the second most important problem in software development or online casino development. The reason is twofold.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On the one hand, the demand for software engineers exceeds the current supply of skilled labor. More and more companies are turning to technology to digitally transform, improve customer service, or leverage better business tools. And while the number of software engineers is also growing, estimated to reach 28.7 million in 2024, there is still a shortage of the best talent, making it difficult to find a suitable and affordable candidate for businesses.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Second, talented engineers are difficult to spot and evaluate at the same time. Their technical savvy is not the only criterion to consider when choosing. Soft skills of a programmer are just as important, and ticking a few check boxes on a scorecard doesn't provide too much valuable insight into a developer's personality and social skills.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So where do you start? While there is no magic formula for finding the best software developer, there are several steps you can take to improve your chances of finding a top-notch developer for your business.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Start with "Why"</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The quality of your software product largely depends on the skills of the developers who create it. To ensure the best fit between the needs of your business and the software engineer, it is important to define for yourself the nature and complexity of the project, as well as your expectations for the developer you want to hire.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If this is a one-off small project with clear responsibilities and tasks, you will most likely want to partner with a freelancer on a one-off basis. On the other hand, if you intend to develop a more complex custom software product that requires a long-term commitment, then hiring a full-time software engineer may be more appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Having clarity about the scope, duration, complexity of the project, and technical and human resource requirements can, in turn, bring greater clarity to your resource needs.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">"Let the hunger games begin"</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Once you have decided what type of developer you need, you can proceed with the actual search. Considering the purpose of the project, financial resources, and the urgency of hiring, there are several strategies to choose from when looking for engineering candidates.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Referrals. The most effective way to find the best software engineers is through your personal and professional networks. Refer to the connectors on your network for developer recommendations that may match your criteria. Chances are, you'll find a highly skilled software engineer who also fits a good culture much faster because you'll get referrals from a similar circle. It is also a low hanging fruit because you are reaching out to a network of which you are already a part.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Internet communities. There are several platforms that are great for finding experienced software engineers.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You can post a list of vacancies and rate candidates as they come, or you can search and in advance contact developers who match your criteria.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On the more specialized front, there are platforms like this that attract the best talent from the software development market, increasing your chances of finding a highly qualified developer for your project.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Other valuable resources are software developer communities such as Quora or the Git Hub, where developers share their know-how or technical skills with fellow engineers. Gaining insight into how a software engineer solves a technical problem, expresses his opinion, or analyzes code quality will help you identify opportunities to find the right candidate for your business through better screening.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Conferences / Bootcamps / Hackathons. You can find software engineers passionate about what they do at these types of events that want to get involved in the community, stay ahead of industry trends, and create great professional relationships. These are developers who are not only interested in improving their technical skills but also looking to improve their interpersonal skills. These meetings allow you to go directly to the candidate you are interested in and start a conversation that will help you understand if a software engineer might be the right fit.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Do not shy away from careful assessment</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The software engineer should be assessed on both his technical acumen and his interpersonal skills.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A high-profile software developer must have experience with various programming languages ​​and software tools, develop versatility, and a willingness to constantly learn and adapt to new technologies, which is very important for software development. However, a technical assessment should cover more than just interviewing a candidate for a specific technology. You want to understand their ability to creatively solve problems and navigate complex concepts by assessing their programming skills. This will go a long way in the long run and ultimately make your software project stand out and add value.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The developer's attitude is just as important as the skill set. In a software project where teamwork contributes to progress, communication skills, both written and oral, are essential for a smooth process. The chemistry between team members is also an important aspect of creating a culture of collaboration.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Software engineers often work in a dynamic environment, always balancing stakeholder needs, technical details, and best practices under pressure. While technological know-how is critical for any software developer to get their jobs done, it takes much more to succeed. Openness, willingness to improve, enthusiasm, versatility, and self-improvement are just a few of the qualities that distinguish high-profile software developers.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the process of finding a top-notch software engineer is challenging, having access to a top-notch developer who can help you create a great product is invaluable. Using the strategies above, there is no doubt that you will be a couple of steps closer to the next ideal candidate to get started with your ambitious project.</span></p>

                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As Car loans are one of the most popular types of loans. However, when completing such a procedure, in addition to standard banking requirements, some conditions must be met. One of them is car <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/insurance-tips/">insurance</a>, the second is life and health insurance with a car loan. This is an additional requirement of banks to provide guarantees of timely repayment of all debts under any circumstances, even if the lender has serious health problems.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This trend is becoming more widespread in banking practice. According to law, life insurance when buying a vehicle in installments is not a prerequisite. However, in reality, getting a car loan without life insurance is becoming more and more difficult.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What is the difference between this type of insurance and traditional insurance? In this case, the insurance contract is drawn up once for the entire duration of the credit contract. It does not need to be renewed once a year until the car loan is paid off.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What does life insurance do for a car loan?</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The right to fully or partially repay the debt under the loan agreement in the event of unforeseen health situations (complete or partial disability or death of the client);</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Protection of the material interests of not only the insured person, but also close relatives (especially if the borrowed person is the only breadwinner in the family);</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the event of early repayment of the loan debt, the life insurance policy continues for the period for which it was concluded.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Life insurance increases the likelihood that a financial institution will issue a loan. In some banks, the absence of such a policy from a potential client is a reason for refusing to issue a loan, because working with problem debts significantly reduces the bank's profit. In this case, the credit manager has every right not to sign the client's application, without even explaining the reasons for the negative answer.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Life insurance is the confidence that the client will return the funds in full and within the period specified in the contract. On the Internet, you can find a lot of information on how to opt out of life insurance for a car loan. If a citizen is firmly confident in his material capabilities and is convinced that he does not need such a service, he has every right to refuse insurance. To do this, you need to fill out the appropriate application form to the bank. After that, the manager will consider it and make a decision.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You need to be ready to refuse to issue a loan or a loan on less favorable terms with higher interest rates. Thus, car insurance insurance in practice is not an additional cost for the client, but, on the contrary, serves as the basis for reducing the cost of the loan. This is a common practice in banking. The financial institution raises the rate when the risk increases and lowers it when the threats of non-payment diminish.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cost of the policy for a car loan</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The amount of premiums for life insurance for car loans depends on the size of the loan. However, as a rule, it is no more than 0.1%.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At the same time, both parties to the transaction: both the bank and the borrower will remain in the black. The first will receive compensation in the amount of the outstanding loan balance, the second will remain the full owner of the car.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How does customer protection work?</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Suppose that an insured event occurs, as a result of which the citizen has lost his health and, as a result, will not be able to fulfill his professional duties, receive income and pay off the loan debt. In this case, the insurance organization pays the bank the remaining amount of the debt under the loan agreement, protecting the interests of its client. In this case, the vehicle taken on credit remains in the possession of the borrower.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Final Words</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Life and health insurance for a car loan is not a prerequisite. However, this service should not be neglected, because it is beneficial not only to the bank, but also to the borrower. Having such insurance on hand, you can count on a positive answer to the issuance of a loan, on the one hand, on the other hand, it will serve as reliable protection for the payment of all financial obligations to the bank. By purchasing a life insurance program, you maintain your financial independence and stability.</span></p>

                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you just log in to an existing WhatsApp account on a new device, the history from the old device will not load. Now you will learn 2 ways to solve this problem and continue communication from exactly where you left off, without unnecessary difficulties.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Option 1: Using Google Drive</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">WhatsApp has the ability to make a copy and save it to Google Drive. This feature is ideal for transferring chats to your new device:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Before you "move" to a new phone, open the WhatsApp application, and tap on the three dots icon.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Go to Settings&gt; Conversations&gt; Chat Backup.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the next window, you can manually select individual chats or configure the creation of a backup copy of conversations automatically at any frequency. Now when you install this application on your new smartphone, the messenger will offer to “get” chats and files from Google Drive.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is the most convenient and fastest way to transfer correspondence to another phone.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Option 2: Create a copy of chats manually</span></h2>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For those who do not use Google Drive, a different method is suitable:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Settings&gt; Chats &amp; Calls&gt; Copy Chats.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Save a copy to a memory card if your smartphone supports it.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Take out the SD card, insert it into the prepared smartphone, restore chats.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What to do for smartphone users without a memory card:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Take a USB cable and connect your device to your PC / laptop.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Find the WhatsApp / Database smartphone folder on your PC or laptop. A previously saved copy is located here. The searched file looks something like this: "msgstore-2020-04-28.db.crypt".</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Transfer the file with the required data to your computer to any convenient folder.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Now install WhatsApp, </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">but don't open the app!</span></strong></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Connect a new smartphone to a PC or laptop via a USB cable. The WhatsApp / Databases directory should have appeared already. If not, create the folder yourself.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Transfer the file with the backup copy of your chats to it.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Only now can WhatsApp be launched.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The screen should display a message stating that a copy of the chats was found - click "Restore".</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After a couple of seconds, the chat history will be loaded on the new smartphone.</span></p>

                    <img src="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/media/posts/218/hard-disk-4255711_640.jpg" alt="Running out of disk space? where is the best place to store photos, films, and programs" />
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Each of us is once faced with the fact that the hard disk space is running out, you need to store them somewhere. It is also better not to fill the hard disk so that the system does not slow down.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In general, there are 3 options for storing files: burn to DVDs, store in the cloud, or purchase an external hard drive.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I will say right away: you should not save the distributions of the programs, because the programs are changing, updated and it is better to download them again from the Internet. Now the time has passed when the programs were stored for several years.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Let's look at each case</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">1. Burning to DVD</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is a cheap option, but inconvenient because when you need something, you will need to search for a disc. Also, the disc is easily damaged and scratched, so the reliability is not very good here. The good thing about this method is that it is very inexpensive. And perhaps that's all.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2. Store in the cloud. </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Many cloud services give you disk space for a price. There are two disadvantages here: a constant subscription fee, as well as the risk that the disk on the server will simply burn out.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">And in the contract for such services, it is written in black and white that the organization is not responsible for failures in work. And of course, you need a powerful Internet channel to upload and download your wealth, and your account can be broken and all your files can become public. In the cloud, I store those files that I need constant access from different devices. It is very convenient!</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">3. The best way</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is an external HDD hard drive. In my opinion, the most reliable. How to choose it? There are two factors here: capacity and reviews. I always choose according to reviews and try to take those models that have already received the proper number of ratings from real users (I don't make new models, I take from a year).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You should not buy a 2 terabyte disk at once, it is better to buy two disks per terabyte or 500 gigabytes each. One to use as a backup. After all, the more places where information will be recorded, the more likely it will be saved. The external drive is easily connected via USB, and in the "This PC" section it appears as a regular hard drive.</span></p>
