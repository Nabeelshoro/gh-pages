                <p>WhatsApp owner promised that the avaibltiy of payment and money transfer in the WhatsApp messenger will be launched in the upcoming six months in other countries, except India.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e04k58400">Whats is WhatsApp Pay and how it Works?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/whatsapp-new-features/">WhatsApp</a> Pay is based on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) - a quick transfer system that unites all banks in supporting countries. Any user can connect their bank card to the <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/whatsapp/">WhatsApp messenger</a> and send money directly through the chat messenger interface. So you can transfer money to a friend and family all over the world.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e04k6bu51">Why WhatsApp Pay first chose India?</h3>
<p>Facebook chose India to test payments due to the anomalous popularity of WhatsApp in this country. This allows you to identify all kinds of problems before introducing the system in other countries. And while WhatsApp remains the most popular messenger in the world. Zuckerberg said that now the daily audience of the service is 1.7 billion users, reports Indiatimes.</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1e04k8s5v3">Why WhatsApp Pay will not support in India?</h4>
Here is the answer: - <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/why-payoneer-is-trusted-money-transfer-service-5-reason-need-to-know.html">Money transfer</a> on WhatsApp has been tested in India for more than a year, but the company encountered difficulties at the stage of processing verification documents for this payment system. <br>Now WhatsApp plans to expand the WhatsApp Payment function to other countries, but the exact list of countries has not yet been listed.

                <p><span >Statistics show that </span><strong><span >16% of the</span></strong><span > adult population, half of which are men of different ages, encounter an ailment such as urinary incontinence. A similar condition is characterized by unconscious reflex urination. He, sooner or later, will manifest such a disease. Especially vulnerable are male citizens whose age </span><strong><span >exceeds 60 years</span></strong><span >.</span></p>
<p><span >Urinary incontinence in men is not a separate disease. Often it is the result of a series of consecutive pathological changes that violate the usual cycle of life. However, the main problem for a man suffering from incontinence is not a deterioration in his physical condition, but psychological discomfort. After all, such an ailment complicates family life, reduces social activity and hinders professional growth. In this post we will guide you best <a href="https://harex.net/en/">Urinary incontinence solutions</a> methods and products.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e002v6n80"><span >Urinary incontinence in men: the main factors.</span></h2>
<p><span >The main reasons that provoke spontaneous emptying of the bladder include the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >incontinence, as a </span><strong><span >result of surgery</span></strong><span > on the pelvic organs: removal of part or all of the prostate gland (prostate), radiation therapy, etc.</span></li>
<li><strong><span >Diseases of the nervous system</span></strong><span >: because the nervous system provides nerve impulses from the brain to the genitourinary system and vice versa, by monitoring and regulating the process of urination, in the event of any violation of the transmission mechanisms of such signals, communication ceases, causing male urinary incontinence of varying severity. Similar diseases of NS include stroke, multiple sclerosis, injuries of the brain or spinal cord, etc.</span></li>
<li><strong><span >Narrowing of the urethra</span></strong><span >: this happens due to an enlargement of the prostate gland, which most often occurs due to age-related changes in the male body. And as a result - intermittent urination or, conversely, an increase in the frequency of urges to urinate, which in most cases develop into an inability to retain urine;</span></li>
<li><strong><span >Urinary incontinence in men with alcohol intoxication</span></strong><span >: alcohol abuse causes damage to the brain, which, in turn, leads to disruption of the urinary system;</span></li>
<li><span >other reasons: age-related and hormonal changes in the male body; congenital and acquired diseases of the genitourinary system.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >Urinary incontinence in men at any age is a problem that, once it occurs, can certainly come back again. What to do if men do not hold urine? in order not to aggravate it, it is simply obliged to seek the advice of a specialist. The doctor will conduct a comprehensive examination, according to the results of which he will conclude what type of disease the patient has encountered and what therapy is indicated to him.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e002v6n91"><span >Urinary incontinence in young men and older men: the main sign and symptoms of the disease</span></h2>
<p><span >Problems with the bladder are observed in both young men and men in old age. Modern experts distinguish the following forms of male incontinence:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span >stress urinary incontinence</span></strong><span >: this is involuntary drip urination in men, characterized by periodicity. It is associated with extreme stress or severe physical exertion. Often observed at the time of coughing, sneezing, laughing, etc.</span></li>
<li><strong><span >urgent (imperative) incontinence</span></strong><span >: abundant urination, which is previously accompanied by a strong urge to the toilet;</span></li>
<li><strong><span >functional incontinence in men</span></strong><span >: involuntary leakage of urine in men after urination. Such an ailment can be caused by a state of health or other factors, because of which the male cannot get to the bathroom on time;</span></li>
<li><strong><span >complete incontinence</span></strong><span >: systematic uncontrolled urination in men. This form of the disease is usually observed in older men when there is a weakening of the muscles of the bladder;</span></li>
<li><strong><span >enuresis:</span></strong><span > bedwetting in men. Most often, such a disease is the result of untreated childhood diseases.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >In turn, enuresis, which occurs in both adults and older men in a dream, is classified (depending on the duration of the disease) into the following types:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >persistent nighttime incontinence in men: a small amount of urine is released nightly;</span></li>
<li><span >recurrent incontinence: with this form of the disease, the exacerbation is observed periodically and alternates with a period of remission. As a rule, this type of enuresis is observed in men who abuse hard drink;</span></li>
<li><span >complete lack of urine in men.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >If at least one of the above signs is detected, the man should immediately consult a doctor. After all, the sooner treatment begins, the more chances to defeat the disease.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e002v6n92"><span >Hygiene products to help discreetly solve male urinary incontinence</span></h2>
<p><span >As you can see, male urinary incontinence is a fairly common problem, which in most cases causes a man of any age to change his usual way of life, to abandon his favorite activities. Therefore, to prevent this from happening, every man is looking for methods to combat the consequences of incontinence during treatment. It is hygiene products, such as men's pads (inserts), absorbent underpants, as well as diapers (diapers) for adults, that will help to quietly solve the problem of urinary incontinence in both young and elderly men. However, before you purchase them, it is important to understand their purpose and species diversity. Today, modern manufacturers offer the following types of men's subtle hygiene products:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span >urological pads (inserts) for Tena men:</span></strong><span > `because such hygienic products ideally retain not only urine but also prevent the appearance of an unpleasant odor, they have become a panacea for those males who want to avoid social maladaptation;</span></li>
<li><strong><span >Seni men's sanitary pads (inserts):</span></strong><span > are characterized not only by their high ability to retain urine and bad smell but also by structural features. All this guarantees a man suffering from spontaneous urination, freedom of movement and maximum comfort. And this means that he will not have to give up his beloved deeds and prolonged communication with loved ones;</span></li>
<li><span ><strong><a href="https://harex.net/en/" title="HAREX DEVICE FOR CONTROL OF MALE INCONTINENCE">Urinary incontinence solutions for men</a>:</strong> thanks to such a hygiene device (HAREX DEVICE FOR CONTROL OF MALE INCONTINENCE) that is placed next to the head of the penis and by gentle pressure on the urethra, urine flow stops, preventing and controlling involuntary leakage.</span></li>

                <span >Windows 7 is perhaps Microsoft's best operating system. No wonder it is so loved by users around the world. Although <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/microsoft-will-no-longer-support-windows-7.html">Microsoft ended the support in January 2020</a>, many users continue to use Windows 7 OS and are not even going to switch to Windows 10. </span><br><span >Let us leave the discussion of whether this is correct or not and focus on how to protect our windows 7 system that no longer receives security updates after January 2020.</span>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dvksd26r4"><span >How to continue to use the Windows 7 operating system without updates.</span></h2>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dvksbrmg0"><span >1. Install a reliable browser</span></h3>
<span >The old browser is the open door for many malicious programs, so this is the first thing you need to pay attention to. Along with the end of support for the operating system itself, updates will no longer come for Internet Explorer. Of course, few people use it, but be aware of use Internet Explorer in Old and expired OS, for example, Windows 7.</span><br><span >Fortunately, third-party browsers still support Windows 7 and are receiving updates. However, this will not last forever. Install any of the browsers: Chrome, Firefox or Opera.</span>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dvksbrmg1"><span >2. Install a third-party antivirus</span></h3>
<span >As with Internet Explorer, the standard antivirus will also stop receiving updates. This means that if you did not use a third-party antivirus relying solely on the built-in tools of the operating system, then it's time to install a third-party antivirus. </span><br><span >In an environment where the operating system is potentially vulnerable, it is better to play it safe. Moreover, this does not have to be a paid product.</span>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dvksbrmg2"><span >3. Do not use an administrator account</span></h3>
<span >Get a regular user account and use it for everyday tasks. This, of course, will affect usability, but your system will be a little safer. The fact is that if your account does not have rights to install programs, then viruses cannot be installed either. Roughly speaking, the system simply will not let the executable file run.</span>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dvksbrmg3"><span >4. Update or change unreliable software</span></h3>
<span >Programs in which there are loopholes for viruses are potentially no less dangerous than an outdated operating system. If you are still actively using some outdated software, such as Microsoft Office 2007, then update or change it. And in general, it is better to select programs carefully. Do not run unknown executable files and download them only from reliable sources.</span><br><span ><em><strong>Final Words:</strong></em> you need to understand that if you do not store anything important on a computer with Windows 7, regularly back up data, don’t pay by credit card online or your PC is not connected to the Internet at all, then the danger is minimized. Active users, in any case, are better off switching to Windows 10 or another current system.</span><br><strong><span >This is also interesting:</span></strong>

The bad impression that some of them also got from Windows 10 is another pointed factor.</span><br><span >While it will no longer provide technical assistance for Windows 7 to the general, Microsoft will continue to support companies and government agencies that want to maintain the system and are willing to pay for it.</span></p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1dtq14em50">Facebook Smartphone Operating System as like Android</h2>
<p>According to the news - After <a href="https://theritetutorials.tech/huawei-appgallery-review-google-play-alternative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huawei</a>, another big technology giant may bring the competitor of the <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/personal-digital-assistant-cortana-will-leave-from-android-and-ios-beginning-2020.html">Android operating system</a>. Facebook. The company has hired software engineer Mark Lucovsky. The operating systems expert who worked on building Microsoft's Windows NT will be responsible for managing a team that will work to develop a new mobile operating system platform.</p>
<p>The upcoming<a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-disable-the-built-in-browser-in-the-facebook-app-for-android.html"> Facebook's</a> mobile operating system will be used in products developed by the company, such as the Oculus virtual reality display and the smart speaker Portal. Currently, both products are still dependent on Android.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure that the next generation has room for us,” said Andrew Bosworth, Facebook's vice president of hardware. “We cannot rely on the market or our competitors to make sure this will happen.”</p>
<p>Also, the plan is to create a platform that can more quickly integrate company-run services such as WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger, for example.</p>
<p>Remember that this is not the first time Zuckerberg's company has tried to create an operating system from scratch. In 2013, Facebook even ran a modified version of the Android platform on a hardware phone made by Chinese HTC. The product did not conquer the market and was soon abandoned.</p>

                <p id="mcetoc_1dscqp7jm0"><span >Going on a trip, you need to familiarize yourself with the features of the transport system of the country in which you plan to travel. After all, any situation leading to a violation, the travel plan can result in intangible losses of time and money. Therefore, it is so important to understand all major types of transport, especially such as taxis. Let's try to find out how the taxi service in Spain works.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dscqp7jo1"><span >Features of a taxi service in Spain.</span></h2>
<p><span >Spain remains a fairly developed country, in which all EU standards apply. And this means that using the services of a taxi, you have the right to count on compliance with safety standards, a satisfactory condition of the car and the mandatory presence of a meter.</span></p>
<p><span >The regions of Spain have their specifics, therefore, you will find a more comfortable trip than anywhere else in all EU.</span></p>
<p><span >An official taxi driver's license is not cheap and you need to go through many bureaucratic procedures to get it, so most Spanish taxi drivers value their workplace and are unlikely to risk their permission for a couple of extra euros.</span></p>
<p><span >As in most European countries, you can use taxi services in the country by placing an order by phone or using a mobile application or simply by catching it on the street. You can also use the services of cars parked in special parking lots.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dscqp7jo2"><span >How to order a taxi in Spain</span></h2>
<p><span >Walking through the streets of Spanish cities, you can see special taxi stands, which can be easily recognized by a blue rectangular sign with a white letter T. You can order a taxi directly at these stops, but certain rules must be observed.</span></p>
<p><span >Most importantly, always get in the car closest to the exit, as there is a sequence of drivers leaving the parking lot. If parking is not enough for everyone, then people with children, pregnant women, the elderly or disabled are the first to get into them.</span></p>
<p><span >You can catch a free car, as in most countries of the world, with a wave of your hand, but keep in mind that the driver is not entitled to pick up a passenger within a radius of 50 meters from the parking lot.</span></p>
<p><span >The fact that the car is free is signaled by a panel with a glowing green light and the sign on the roof of the car. Therefore, it would be most reasonable to book a transfer from the airport to the hotel in advance.</span></p>
<p><span >Finally, you can always ask to call you a car at the reception of your hotel: however, the reasonableness of the prices of the company whose services you are offered to use will remain solely on the conscience of the hotel staff.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dscqp7jo3"><span >Taxi rates in Spain</span></h2>
<p><span >The cost of your trip will depend on many factors, among which the main ones are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >a region in which the trip takes place;</span></li>
<li><span >base rate;</span></li>
<li><span >distance;</span></li>
<li><span >Times of Day;</span></li>
<li><span >car class;</span></li>
<li><span >additional services (child car seat, luggage, etc.).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >Sometimes you will have to pay extra for entry into the territory of airports, seaports, railway stations, and some other facilities. The cost of the trip can also increase due to standing in traffic jams.</span></p>
<p><span >The most popular brand of taxi cars in almost the whole country is the Taxi2Spain, and specilly in <a href="https://taxi2spain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Madrid transfer</a>.</span><span >You can find the additional feature of taxi2spain by visiting their website here taxi2spain.com.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dscqp7jo4"><span >Useful Tips</span></h2>
<p><span >As mentioned above, the loss of a license is a nightmare of taxi drivers, so there is no reason to expect obvious fraud from them because only one complaint from a passenger can cost them a career. </span></p>
<p><span >The best way is to write your destination in large letters on a piece of paper (or a mobile phone screen) in advance and show the driver when landing. If you order a taxi in advance, for example, using the Taxi2Spain service that works perfectly in Spain, then such misunderstandings will not happen at all.</span></p>
<p><span >Taxi rules in Spain are quite liberal but stricter. You can stop the car on the road almost everywhere except airports, but smoking in the passenger compartment is strictly forbidden, and you have every right to refuse to get into the vehicle passenger compartment while intoxicated.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dscqp7jo5"><span >Finally</span></h2>
<p><span >Spain has a developed and reliable taxi system. Using a taxi in Spain is practically safe, as their work is regulated by the state. Taxis operate at rates that are also determined by the state. However, they may vary slightly depending on the region. Besides, it should be noted that at night, as well as on holidays and weekends, tariffs are higher.</span></p>
<p><span >Keep in mind that not all taxi drivers in Spain speak English, so if you do not know Spanish, you should have a business card or address of your final destination with you. have a nice trip to Spain.</span></p>

                <p id="mcetoc_1dsa2u5pe0">In this article, we will guide you on How to check the brand for Vegan Cosmetics and which components should not be included</p>
<p><span >In the past few years, the popularity of brands that do not test their products on animals is growing rapidly. A study by Grand View Research showed that by 2025 the market for Vegan Cosmetics will reach $ 20.8 billion. The average annual growth rate for sales of vegan cosmetics is 6.3%. A great interest in vegan cosmetics is primarily among millennials. The reason for the growing interest in this niche was the desire of people to take care of personal health and the environment.</span></p>
<p><span >Often, ideas about vegan cosmetics are wrong. Many people think that this is only cruelty-free, but not only the ban on testing cosmetic products on animals is important here, but also the complete exclusion from the composition of products of animal origin, for example, beeswax, lanolin, and colored carmine pigment.</span></p>
<p><span >Another misconception is that vegan foods do not contain synthetic ingredients and chemicals. This is not true. Vegan brands include both herbal ingredients and synthetic ones for preservation or texture uniformity.</span></p>
<p>Related: <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-find-a-perfect-developer-for-you-company.html">How to find a perfect developer for your company?</a></p>
<p><span >The phrase "vegan makeup" can cause bewilderment and even distrust. But thanks to modern technology, vegan brands are not inferior in quality and variety to others. “A few years ago, I would agree that there would be a loss in variety when choosing vegan makeup products, But the technologies and compositions improved beyond recognition.”</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dsa33mmo2"><span >How to check a best vegan brand?</span></h2>
<p><span >First, a complete list of cosmetic ingredients that are not suitable for vegans can be found on arolaborganic.com/en. Secondly, a list of best vegan brands is available at <a href="https://www.arolaborganic.com/en/" title="Vegan Beauty best website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vegan beauty</a>. On the packaging of cosmetics and this website of the brand have <a href="https://www.arolaborganic.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arolab</a>, not tested on animals. You can also check the brand through the above website.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dsa3j4cja"><strong><span >Ingredients that should not be in the composition. </span></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><span >Beeswax - may be designated as Cera alba or cera Flava</span></li>
<li><span >Carmine is a red dye derived from carmine acid, which is produced by female cochineal insects. May be labeled as carmine acid.</span></li>
<li><span >Lanolin - wool wax, animal wax obtained by digesting sheep wool. May be referred to as aliphatic alcohols, isopropyl lanceolate, planet, lanolin, lanolin alcohols, lanosterols, sterols or triterpene alcohols.</span></li>
<li><span >Glycerin - it is obtained by the saponification of animal fats. It can be found in the composition as the glyceride, glyceryl, glycret-26 or polyglycerol.</span></li>
<li><span >Honey - apis mellifera is sometimes noted.</span></li>
<li><span >Fish scales - used in cosmetics for a flicker effect. It is marked as guanine, CI 75170 or natural pearl essence.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >There are controversial components, both animal origin and derived from plants. These are elastin, keratin, and squalane. In such cases, the “veganism” of the brand is better specified using the above sources.</span></p>
