                    <img src="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/media/posts/198/health-1175296_640.jpg" alt="How does health insurance work?" />
                <p id="mcetoc_1e4o5tlat0">In this article we will guide you how does health insurance work and how you can apply for that.</p>
<p><span >The essence of medical insurance is that a person who buys an annual policy, upon the occurrence of an insured event (illness or injury), gets the right to free and extraordinary medical care within the framework of the budgets and the list of services that are provided for them. The budgets themselves, the list of services, the level of hospitals and clinics depend on the specific insurer, the price of the policy, as well as the age and state of human health. Roughly speaking, the younger and healthier you are, the cheaper the insurance will cost. As a rule, it guarantees inpatient (treatment in a hospital), outpatient (call a doctor at home), emergency (ambulance departure) assistance, payment and delivery of medicines. Insurance can cover the cost of treatment in whole or in part. If the insured is ill, he needs to call the insurance call center and explain the essence of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span >The client will be refused insurance if he has:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >disability;</span></li>
<li><span >congenital diseases;</span></li>
<li><span >disease window</span></li>
<li><span >diabetes;</span></li>
<li><span >tuberculosis;</span></li>
<li><span >HIV</span></li>
<li><span >chronic renal failure;</span></li>
<li><span >drug or alcohol addiction.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >Depending on the specific IC, the “forbidden” list may change, but not significantly.</span></p>
<p><span >In most countries, compulsory health insurance exists when a person is insured by the state or the employer, and the cost of the policy is deducted from the state budget or his salary. Our health insurance is purely voluntary. And you will have to pay for it either yourself, or the employer will do it for you if he considers it necessary.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4o5tlau1"><span >How did I choose insurance</span></h2>
<p><span >Alas, I do not have corporate insurance. Therefore, I searched for a policy myself. The “dental package” was decisive for me. I was interested in both planned (prophylactic) and unplanned (sudden toothache) treatment, as well as dental prosthetics. I called the top ten companies - leader rating in the field of health insurance. As it turned out, most of them do not insure individuals and only works with the corporate sector. Only three insurance companies offered individual insurance. In each of them, I considered two policies. The first is the recommendation of the insurance agent based on my wishes for services and price. The second is the policy with the highest limit on dentistry. Here is what came of it.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e4o5tlau2"><span >Terms of registration</span></h3>
<p><span >To obtain insurance, you need a passport and identification code. To sign the contract you will have to fill out a declaration of health. This is a questionnaire in which you need to answer several questions in detail: indicate the diseases that you previously had, chronic ailments and disabilities, if any, etc. At the same time, consultants recommend not to be cunning, since at the very first insured event the examination will show the patient's real state. Any indicated untruth may become a reason for the non-payment of compensation for insurance treatment.</span></p>
<p><span >The policy takes effect 14 days after signing, but you can agree on an earlier "activation". The company works with both private and public hospitals and pharmacies. The level of the facility depends on the class of policy. There can be seven of them in the "Provident" for individuals. The cheapest works only with state and departmental hospitals, private clinics appear in the Elite, and VIP guarantees the services of even branded commercial clinics (such as Boris, Dobrobut, etc.). When treating in partner hospitals, the limit covers the full cost of treatment within the limit, in the rest - half. In private clinics and laboratories, a franchise of 25% to 75% is possible. An up-to-date list of partners with the size of payment and interest of franchises is sent by the manager upon request. Medicines can be issued for free only at the network of partner pharmacies, and those drugs that fall under the exception will have to be purchased on their own. Change the clinic or the doctor, if suddenly you are not satisfied with his qualifications, or, for example, he will be a boor, you can call the call center.</span></p>
<p><span >Insured events are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >acute diseases that threaten health and life;</span></li>
<li><span >chronic diseases (up to 3 exacerbations per year);</span></li>
<li><span >accidents arising out of no fault of the client;</span></li>
<li><span >unscheduled surgical intervention (if an operation is necessary in case of a chronic disease or accident).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >The list of exclusions from insurance cases is longer - 2 sheets of A4 12 font. In short: insurance does not cover all cosmetic, preventive and non-traditional, as well as planned surgical interventions, orthodontics, and prosthetics. If this rule is applied to dentistry, then insurance does not cover preventive brushing, teeth whitening, installation of crowns and braces, as well as consultations with doctors on these issues.</span></p>

                <p><span >Many of us work from home during these difficult days, but few manage to maintain concentration and focus on their work. No matter what distracts you, Today The Tricks Peak author brings you below 10 tools that will help you concentrate when working from home and do your job better.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4g5kdri0"><span >1. Focus matrix</span></h2>
<p><span >A task manager for Mac, which will help you prioritize correctly and not break your concentration. For simplicity, all incoming tasks are divided by time and importance, while urgent matters may not be very significant, but non-urgent ones, on the contrary, are extremely important.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4g5kdrj1"><span >2. Pomotroid</span></h2>
<p><span >The Pomodoro technique is the easiest way to deal with procrastination, maintaining a balance between work and leisure. This application for Windows, macOS, and Linux will adhere to the system "25 minutes of work - 5 minutes of rest." If standard time periods are not suitable, you can set your own in the settings. Free Download</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4g5kdrj2"><span >3. Hocus focus</span></h2>
<p><span >Multitasking is one of the main enemies of productivity. Hocus Focus for Mac helps you stay focused, leaving only the current window active and hiding the rest. The application has several profiles that allow you to configure the time after which the windows will be minimized. By default, the delay is 30 seconds, but in focus mode, as soon as you switch to one of the applications, all the others are hidden.</span></p>
<p><span >Download (free)</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4g5kdrj3"><span >4. Momentum</span></h2>
<p><span >The Momentum browser extension is designed to deter the temptation to procrastinate on the Internet: on all new tabs, it displays inspirational images and motivating quotes. It displays the time, the main goal for the day and task lists. All this so that you do not forget why you went online.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4g5kdrj4"><span >5. Rooster</span></h2>
<p><span >Like Momentum, Rooster uses the new Chrome tab, which usually leads to the temptation to mess around. The extension will show how much time has been spent on which pages, and will also be able to display notifications that you have been on unproductive sites for too long.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4g5kdrj5"><span >6. Just focus</span></h2>
<p><span >If you don’t have much self-control, the extension for Chrome Just Focus will help. Enter in its settings the addresses of the sites to which you are most distracted, and after turning on the focus mode, they will be temporarily blocked. When you go to a page from the blacklist, the Just Focus screen will appear instead of it with an inspirational quote.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4g5kdrj6"><span >7. Self-control</span></h2>
<p><span >A more hardcore counterpart to the previous extension as a program for macOS. Self ‑ Control is tougher: after setting the timer, all sites from the blacklist will not open in any browser. Moreover, closing the application will not do anything: the lock will be released only after a specified time has passed. Download (free)</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4g5kdrj7"><span >8. Focusmusic.fm</span></h2>
<p><span >When everyone around is messing around and interfering, but there is no separate room for privacy, all that remains is to put on headphones and isolate yourself with music. Focusmusic.fm has four channels, including electronics and classics, as well as the sounds of rain. You can listen both from the site and through mobile applications. Go to the website</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4g5kdrj8"><span >9. Spectacle</span></h2>
<p><span >Many have large monitors in the office, but at home, they usually have to be content with a laptop. Spectacle Utility for Mac makes it easier to manage windows by resizing them and distributing screen space based on tasks. All manipulations occur with the help of hotkeys, you don’t have to aim at the borders with the cursor. Download (free)</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4g5kdrj9"><span >10. Flowstate</span></h2>
<p><span >Unusual text editor for those who can not work without a magic pedal. Flowstate for macOS will force you to write under the pain of losing all typed text. If you stop typing, then after 5 seconds everything will be deleted. </span></p>
<p><span >I hope, you will like the above list of tools. feel free to comment on this post.</span></p>

                <p><span >These Google Chrome features are available without additional extensions.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e3msl3cr0"><span >1. Shortcut to any page on the desktop</span></h3>
<p><span >If you have a lot of bookmarks in the browser, and you need to save a few more links for a while, use the shortcut function. With its help, you can send it to the desktop a website icon that redirects immediately to the page you need.</span></p>
<p><span >To do this, open the <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-clean-up-and-group-tabs-in-google-chrome.html">Chrome settings</a> on the selected page and select "Advanced Tools". In the submenu, there will be an item for creating a shortcut. Click on it and give the link a name.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e3msl3cs1"><span >2. Save page to PDF</span></h3>
<p><span >If you need to save the page exactly in the form in which it is displayed in the browser, you can use the save function in PDF format. It is available through the Print menu. To go to it, press Ctrl + P and select the option “Save as PDF” on the left.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e3msl3cs2"><span >3. View a cached version of a site</span></h3>
<p><span >To return to an earlier version of a web page or open an article already removed from the site, you can <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/gg.html">access the cache</a>. To do this, add “cache:” before the page address and press “Enter”. In the same way, you can open previously viewed pages without connecting to the Web.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e3msl3cs3"><span >4. Return a closed tab with a key combination</span></h3>
<p><span >There are several ways to open the last closed tab. The most inconvenient is to find the page in the browser history. A little more practical is to right-click on another tab and select "Open Closed Tab" in the drop-down menu.</span></p>
<p><span >The fastest way is to use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + T.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e3msl3cs4"><span >5. Watching YouTube in Picture-in-Picture Mode</span></h3>
<p><span >To work in a browser or other programs without interrupting <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/3-free-ways-to-download-youtube-videos.html">YouTube</a>, a video can be opened in a separate window that will be displayed on top of all applications. To do this, go to the desired video, right-click on it, opening the first menu of the basic settings, and then click here a second time. Another context menu will open, in which there will be an item "Picture in Picture".</span></p>
<p><span >This function transfers the clip to a small window that will remain on the screen even if you minimize the browser. The size of the window can be adjusted by stretching it over the edges in different directions.</span></p>
<p><span >That's all, Now your turn, Which of the features of Google Chrome Browser do you use? Share in the comments!</span></p>

<p><span >You can click on it and change the hue of the group of tabs, and also give it a name.</span></p>
<p><span >When you want to assign a tab to an already created group, right-click it and select <strong>"Add to an existing group."</strong> Or just drag the item with the mouse.</span></p>

                <p><span >Did you face a 404 error, while <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-use-icloud-website-on-other-browser-and-smartphones.html">browsing the internet</a> once in a lifetime, you actively use the Internet has had to deal with it? In most cases, this causes discontent and the user immediately closes the error page. But if you have a book market that page and have very important information or article and you need to read it again. However, today <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/frontpage/1">The Tricks Peak</a> author brings you several ways to solve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span >With active surfing on the Internet, you often have to deal with broken pages or entire sites. This usually happens when you follow a link from a search engine or your bookmarked pages. In this case, a special page appears with code 404.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e37rt7i60"><span >Verify Address</span></h2>
<p><span >The first thing to do is to check the page address. If you entered it manually, then there may be typos or extra characters. If you follow the link, then the problem may be in it. Since people fill the sites, they too can make mistakes and put broken links. In this case, you must carefully review the address. </span></p>
<p><span >Copy the full address of the link: right-click on the link and select "Copy link address". Paste it into any text editor and review it carefully. Perhaps in the link, there are extra characters, spaces or something else is out of order.</span></p>
<p><span >Try also to search for the page address in the search engine. Perhaps the search engine will give the correct link without errors.</span></p>
<p><span >Also, the page could be renamed, but the redirect is not configured. In this case, you will not be transferred to a new address. It is impossible to guess what exactly changed the page address. One can only assume that it is still on the site and has a similar name. Try to search the page for keywords on the site itself or through a <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-does-the-google-most-relevant-search-for-us.html">search engine</a>.</span></p>
<p><span >You can also write to the owners of the site, perhaps they will prompt you a new address or give the necessary information.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e37rt7i61"><span >Try a different browser</span></h2>
<p><span >It is unlikely, but still worth trying another browser. If the page opens in it, then the problem is on your side. Try clearing your browser cache. </span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e37rt7i62"><span >Find the saved copy of the page</span></h2>
<p><span >If all else fails, you can try to find a saved copy of the page. This can be done through a search engine or website web.archive.org.</span></p>
<p><span >If you went to a page from a search engine, then return to the search results and open a cached copy. You can also open a copy right away using the cache statement.</span></p>
<p><span >Website web.archive.org offers a little more functionality. If the page was popular, then you can find several copies of it stored at different times.</span></p>

                <span >Today I will tell you how to download Instagram videos using online services, browser extensions, third-party programs, and applications.</span><br><span >After reading this you will learn about 4 ways of downloading <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-enable-dark-theme-on-instagram.html">Instagram</a> videos. Some methods are repeated, but there are still differences.</span>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e2kceh1o0"><span >1. Browser extension</span></h2>
<span >This is the easiest way to download videos from Instagram. We tested the extension for the Chrome browser called “Downloading photos from Instagram + Direct”. It has a large user base and good reviews.</span><br><span >The extension works almost the same as when saving a photo.</span>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e2kceh1r1"><span >2. Online services</span></h2>
<span >In the case of Instagram video, one of the convenient ways to download them to your computer or smartphone is through special websites called download Instagram videos online. The service is always at hand. Also, some of them are universal and allow you to download media content from several popular video sources at once.</span>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e2kceh1r2"><span >3. Screen recording</span></h2>
<span >If the photo can be saved by taking a screenshot, then this method is also suitable for video. This is especially true for owners of devices with iOS 11 and above. Starting with this version of the operating system, the device can record what is happening on the screen without additional tricks. For Android users, we cannot recommend this method, because you have to install a third-party application. It is better to immediately install the application that allows you to download videos from Instagram.</span><br><span >If you need to start recording with sound, then hold your finger on the icon until an additional menu appears. Activate the microphone, as the sound will be recorded from it.</span>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e2kceh1r3"><span >4. 4K Video Downloader</span></h2>
<p><span >The free 4K Video Downloader program allows you to download videos not only from YouTube but also on Instagram, as well as many other video hosting sites.</span><br><span >Copy the link to the post containing the video, and in the program, click the "Insert link" button. A new window will open with the video options. Unlike YouTube, you cannot select the quality and format of the video, but the ability to download only the audio track is still present.</span><br><span >If you have Android, you can use the Video Downloader for Instagram application. It is very simple to work with it: copy the link to the post in the application or on the website and open Video Downloader. Everything should happen automatically. The video is saved to the gallery, from where it can be viewed.</span></p>

                <p><span >The official Instagram help center </span><a target="_blank" href="https://help.instagram.com/897760233943762" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span ><a href="https://help.instagram.com/897760233943762" rel="nofollow">says</a></span></a><span > that only devices with Android 10 and iOS 13 can turn on the dark mode. However, for older smartphones, there are also ways to turn on the dark theme, but they are not so simple.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e2hpok3k0"><span >How to turn on dark mode on Android.</span></h2>
<p><span >On Android, dark mode is activated in the settings. </span><strong><span >Scroll down to the Screen menu and turn on the Dark Theme button. </span></strong><span >Unfortunately, this setting is not available on all devices. Therefore, if you have just such a smartphone, then </span><strong><span >you can use third-party applications from Google Play.</span></strong></p>
<p><span >Please note that a dark theme activated through the application may work partially or incorrectly, and is also not applicable to all devices. You may need to try several different applications. If successful, Instagram will also go into dark mode automatically.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e2hpok3l1"><span >How to turn on dark mode on iOS.</span></h2>
<p><span >Like Android, the dark mode for Apple devices is turned on along with the system settings. Such a function is available on iOS 13. </span><strong><span >To turn on dark mode, go to Settings and select “Screen and Brightness”, then activate the dark theme.</span></strong></p>
<p><span >It can also be turned on from the Control Center. Swipe the screen up and hold your finger on the brightness control. In the window that opens, quick switching of the dark and light modes will be available.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e2hpok3l2"><span >How to turn on dark mode on the old version of iO42S.</span></h2>
<p><strong><span >On earlier versions - iOS 11 and 12, you can use smart inversion. This is not a full-fledged, but still a replacement for the dark theme</span></strong><span >. Smart inversion is a kind of predecessor of a full-fledged dark theme, so it works the same way. Go to the settings and select "Universal Access", then "Display and text size." Turn on Smart Inversion.</span></p>

<p><span >You can save Youtube videos to your computer using online service, or special programs and browser extensions.</span></p>
<p><span >It is no doubt that Youtube is a big source of Videos while watching youtube videos surely you came across a situation where you need to save a YouTube video to your computer. If you want to save video from your channel, then you can do this using the Youtube Studio Dashboard. And if it is a video uploaded by another user, you will have to use any third-party tools. So today I have gathered here 3 free and easy ways to download Youtube videos.</span></p>
<p><span ><strong>1.</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.4kdownload.com/ru/products/product-videodownloader" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer">4K Video </a></span><a href="https://www.4kdownload.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span >Downloader</span></a><span >is a free program. It allows you to download videos not only from YouTube but also from many other video hosting sites. Also, the program allows you to download both single video and entire playlists.</span></p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/media/posts/191/3-free-ways-to-download-YouTube-videos.jpg" alt="" width="1562" height="407"></p>
<p><span >Copy the link and click the "Insert link" button. a new window opens with the video settings. You can choose the quality and format of the video or download only the audio track. </span></p>
<p><span ><strong>2.</strong> If you don’t feel like downloading and installing a special program, or if you need to download the video once on someone else’s computer, you can use the online service. There are a lot of them, but one of the most popular is <strong>savefrom.net</strong>.</span></p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/media/posts/191/3-free-ways-to-download-YouTube-videos-2.jpg" alt="" width="1307" height="665"></p>
<p><span ><strong>3.</strong> Another, easy way to download Youtube videos is to install browser extensions. It works simply: a button appears next to the video, allowing you to start downloading the video. There are enough offers in the online store of the browser. </span></p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/media/posts/191/3-free-ways-to-download-YouTube-videos-3.jpg" alt="" width="1699" height="580"></p>
<p><span >However, in reality, not everything is so simple. Many extensions quickly lose relevance, and developers are in no hurry to make updates. Therefore, you need to carefully watch which extension you are downloading. For Firefox, you can install the extension with the long name </span><a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/easy-youtube-video-download/" class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span ><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/easy-youtube-video-download/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Easy Youtube Video Downloader Express</a></span></a><span >. At the time of writing, it worked, also, the application is marked as recommended. </span></p>
<p><span >For Chrome, you can’t download such an extension from the official store. The fact is that Google does not allow applications with the ability to download videos from YouTube to their store. As a result, this method is difficult to recommend, but this option is possible and, perhaps, it will suit you.</span></p>

                <p><span >Here is a list of 6 best tools to transfer your favorite music playlist from one music service provider to another, you can use them, and you do not have to compile the music library again.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e1ho8tm80"><span >1. Soundiiz</span></h2>
<p><span >The easiest way to transfer the music playlist is to use </span><span >Soundiiz</span><span > . It supports many music services such as Google Play Music, Apple Music, YouTube, Last.fm, Spotify and Deezer. There are also some additional on the list of compatible streaming services: Telmore Musik, JOOX, Anghami, and KKBox.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e1hobl776"><span >How to use Soundiiz?</span></h3>
<p><span >Connect your streaming services to Soundiiz, then select the desired playlist with the right mouse button and click Convert to ... If necessary, the program can remove duplicate tracks from the list. And you just have to assign where to transfer the playlist.</span></p>
<p><span >You can import through Soundiiz and local collections of musical compositions in the format of M3U, CSV, XSPF, etc. To do this, click the Import Playlist button in the upper right. The service also accepts lists of favorite songs in simple TXT text files, provided that the tracks there are recorded in the form “Song Name - Artist Name”, one per line.</span></p>
<p><span >Soundiiz has the ability to sync collections from different music platforms. For example, you can add a song to your Deezer playlist, and it appears in Spotify. But this feature is only available with a Premium Subscription for $ 4.5 per month.</span></p>
<p><span >In addition, the free Soundiiz plan has a limitation: you can transfer no more than 200 songs to a playlist. You can get around it by scattering your tracks on several lists. In addition, copying compositions in batches is more reliable, since you can more accurately track which songs were not in the library of the new service. Here is <a href="https://soundiiz.com/" rel="nofollow">soundiiz</a>.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e1ho8tma1"><span >2. Tune My Music</span></h2>
<p><span >A similar service as like Soundiiz, however, supporting less streaming. Open Tune My Music and choose which platform you want to transfer playlists. It supports Google Play Music, Apple Music, YouTube, Deezer, Last.fm, Spotify , Soundcloud, Tidal, iTunes, as well as text files and collections created in local music players.</span></p>
<p><span >Then specify which collections and tracks to transfer, and select the streaming service where they should be sent.</span></p>
<p><span >The service will display which songs were copied successfully, and which songs were not found in the database of the target music platform. The list of such tracks can be saved and then try to add them manually or listen on another platform.</span></p>
<p><span >Tune My Music is slower than Soundiiz, but has a simpler interface. In addition, it has a free sync option for up to 10 playlists. There are no premium features purchased separately. Here is <a href="https://www.tunemymusic.com/" rel="nofollow">Tune My Music</a>. </span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e1ho8tma2"><span >3. Soundsgood</span></h2>
<p><span >Soundsgood is primarily designed to create playlists and then share them with the world. The service also helps to search for new tracks by viewing the lists of songs of various genres compiled by users.</span></p>
<p><span >But Soundsgood can also be used to transfer playlists from one music platform to another. The service works with Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, Napster, YouTube, Soundcloud, and Qobuz. Here is <a href="https://soundsgood.co/" rel="nofollow">Soundgood</a>.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e1hoc1jv7"><span >How to use Soundgood?</span></h3>
<p><span >Sign up with Soundsgood, and then open your streaming service and select the playlist you want to transfer. You need to make it public by clicking on the "Share" button and copy the link. Then in Soundsgood, click Import and paste the link.</span></p>
<p><span >The service imports your songs. You can clean the playlist by removing the extra from there, or add some more songs. Then click “Next” and indicate which music platform to transfer. </span></p>
<p><span >There is a premium subscription, but only DJs or owners of small record labels need it because it allows you to use the service for commercial purposes. For a simple transfer of playlists, a free version will be enough.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e1ho8tma3"><span >4. Mooval</span></h2>
<p><span >A simple and absolutely free service that supports only three platforms: Deezer, Spotify, and Napster. You select where to transfer playlists from, and click the Connect button.</span></p>
<p><span >You will be prompted to enter credentials for both music platforms (sending and receiving), and Mooval will display all your playlists, tracks, and likes. Uncheck the songs, artists, and albums that you don’t need to transfer, and click Move. Here is the <a href="https://www.mooval.de/" rel="nofollow">Mooval</a>.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e1ho8tma4"><span >5. MusConv</span></h2>
<p><span >MusConv is not a web service, but a desktop application available on Windows and macOS. It supports about 30 music platforms, including Google Play Music, Apple Music, YouTube, Deezer, </span><span >Last.fm</span><span > , Spotify, Soundcloud, Tidal, Napster, and more.</span></p>
<p><span >Install the application and connect it to the service from where you want to pick up playlists. Then select the desired tracklists, press Transfer and specify where to transfer them. MusConv will do the rest for you.</span></p>
<p><span >Unfortunately, you have to pay for the application to work, you will need to subscribe, which costs $ 6.99 per month. However, this is not so much expansive. Here is <a href="https://musconv.com/" rel="nofollow">MusConv</a>. </span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e1ho8tma5"><span >6. Stamp</span></h2>
<p><span >Another application is available on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. Supports Spotify, Google Play Music, Apple Music, Tidal, Amazon Music, Pandora, Deezer, and YouTube.</span></p>
<p><span >In addition, Stamp can import your songs with lists in CSV format. So, you can create a playlist in your favorite desktop player and send it to the streaming service - those songs that are in the platform’s library will be recognized and added to the playlist.</span></p>
<p><span >But Stamp asks for money for his work - no more than 10 songs can be converted for free. A single payment of $ 12.99 will remove all restrictions. Here is <a href="https://freeyourmusic.com/" rel="nofollow">Stamp</a> site. </span></p>

On a Mac, it will display <strong>“Inappropriate”</strong> with no sync icon. Here is a complete list of invalid file names in iCloud.</span>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e0d7v3il0"><strong><span >Invalid File and Folder Names in iCloud.</span></strong></h2>
<ul>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1e0d8016m2"><span >Why do you need this restriction? </span></h2>
