                The new year 2020 is getting closer. Users of the <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/you-can-try-the-explore-section-in-the-web-version-of-facebook.html">Facebook</a> Messenger application often send new year's wishes to others, at the moment of the new year Facebook Messenger users feel difficulty to send new year wishes to their friends and relatives. As many as 1.3 billion Messenger users are known to send more messages on New Year's Eve moments, compared to normal days. Not only text messages, but the intensity of sending photos and videos has also increased many times compared to other days. <br> In this article, we will guide you on how to prevent server overload and Message sending failed problem in Facebook Messenger on new year's eve. <br>Well, related to the <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-use-fb-messenger-in-web-browser.html">Messenger application</a>, Facebook has its way to handle huge traffic of messages sent simultaneously during New Year's Eve, so that the server is not broken, or unable to serve traffic. Knowing this, Messenger technicians also made several steps to handle traffic in the application, ahead of New Year's Eve. Here are some ways that sending messages easily in the Messenger application. <br><br>
<ol>
<li><strong>Test the server load:</strong> The technicians do server load testing. Before the New Year's Eve, Facebook had already made a simulation by sending several messages that would be received to fellow Messenger users. From here, you can see whether this time the server's ability to handle the traffic flow of the message or not. If you can't, then the allocation of messages that appear to be booming will be transferred to another server. This technique is the same as that done by the Messenger last year. On New Year's Eve 2018, the Messenger team provided an additional server to divert incoming messages to the chat application to prevent overloading on the server.</li>
<li><strong>Low-Priority Mode:</strong> Facebook has created a mechanism of "low-priority" to prevent the booming of messages that could make the server overload due to being sent simultaneously. "We have set up our system, if the server is dense, the system will start to divert traffic to low-priority mode," said Isaac Ahdout, Engineering Manager for Facebook Messenger. This low-priority mechanism will prioritize the messages sent so that they get to other users quickly.  The way this system works is by making priorities, sorting and choosing which features will be "turned off" first, to reduce server pressure and burden. For example, the read receipt feature, or a message alert that has been read, will be temporarily deactivated to increase resource allocation for messages to be sent. Then the Messenger technician can also turn off the "online" green circle, which helps ease the server load. Another example, Messenger will suspend detailed information about old messages for a while, to ease the server's CPU load. Thus, messages that go in and out will be prioritized first so they can be received quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduler Feature:</strong> Messenger technicians work on a project called "scheduler". This scheduler allows the system to unify several messages whose contents are similar. Later, integration with the principle of "affinity" will ease the burden on the server, because similar messages will be sent as a group. This process, according to Isacc, will ease the CPU load, because the server receives the message sending request process only once for many collections of messages, rather than having to send it one at a time as a process.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also read: <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null">How to disable the built-in Browser in the Facebook App in the Android </a></p>
<p><strong>As a result,</strong> server latency will be reduced by a few milliseconds, so that all messages can be sent smoothly. Facebook servers are still able to handle the swirling billions of users who send messages through the application. <br> However, if the Messenger server is oversupplied due to being crammed with messages simultaneously, then one of the three things will be an alternative solution to ease the burden on the server. Plus, some technicians were on standby in several places to be ready to activate the solution related to problems that might occur ahead of the new year's eve of 2020.</p>

Do not miss the opportunity to take advantage of the best offers and make a lot of successful purchases. Black Friday is more than just a holiday for discounts.</span></p>
<p><span > Want to know why we love to buy on Black Friday so much?</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dqgeeepj0"><span >5 Reasons to Buy on Black Friday</span></h2>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dqgeeepj1"><span >1. "Black Friday" - a day of crazy discounts</span></h3>
<p><span >Black Friday is the long-awaited day of the year for many shopping enthusiasts. And when is the most anticipated sale of the year? In the United States, Black Friday immediately comes after Thanksgiving. </span><strong><span >This year, Black Friday on November 29th.</span></strong></p>
<p><span >Black Friday begins the traditional Christmas season for discounts. But it is on Black Friday that </span><strong><span >many shopping centers and supermarkets arrange huge sales for their customers.</span></strong><span > If you have been looking at some product for some time, then this day is the best time to finally purchase this item at the best price. However, you should plan everything - “Black Friday” offers truly breathtaking discounts, and we do not recommend “yawning”, otherwise you might get ahead.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dqgeeepj2"><span >2. "Black Friday" - time for sales in online stores</span></h3>
<p><span >Are you annoyed by the "<a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/your-content-marketing-strategies-decide-search-results-for-business.html">flea market</a>" in shopping centers? If so, "Black Friday" is your chance, because on this day in many online stores you can find a lot of profitable offers. In the case of purchasing goods online, you do not need to go to shopping centers crowded with visitors and stand in long lines. </span><strong><span >On the Internet, you have the opportunity to calmly and leisurely compare products with each other and then make a meaningful decision. </span></strong><span >Also, you do not run the risk of falling and being trampled by a rampant crowd of people chasing cheap goods.</span></p>
<p><span >And if you are truly a true fan of online shopping, you might want to wait a few days. </span><strong><span >Cyber ​​Monday, the day when millions and millions of people make bargains over the Internet,</span></strong><span > follows immediately the weekend after Black Friday. At Cyber ​​Monday, online stores arrange discounts and sales for their customers, similar to Black Friday <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/brandbucket-marketplace-of-premium-domain-names-for-sale.html">discounts and sales</a>. Online fever lasts longer than regular, store-based fever.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dqgeeepj3"><span >3. "Black Friday" - a great opportunity to buy everything you need for Christmas</span></h3>
<p><span >Are you one of those who always buy Christmas presents at the very last moment? If so, then we don’t envy you - you not only spend the best part of your holidays in this unpleasant “flea market”, but also </span><strong><span >spend much more time, money and nerves on buying gifts.</span></strong><span > If you wholeheartedly hate Christmas shopping, maybe it's time to change something.</span></p>
<p><span >Buy everything you need to celebrate Christmas on Black Friday - it’s beneficial on all sides! Perhaps, in this case, you will not be able to escape the crowd (unless, of course, you make purchases online), but </span><strong><span >you can purchase the goods you need at the best prices.</span></strong><span > Having bought everything in advance, you will get much more pleasure from the festive weeks, since you will not need to run around the shops and buy gifts at the very last minute.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dqgeeepj4"><span >4. Black Friday lasts longer than any other Friday.</span></h3>
<p><span >Do you enjoy shopping late at night? Do you love shopping at the most unusual time of the day? If so, then Black Friday is undoubtedly the best event for you. It allows you to </span><strong><span >go shopping at the most unusual times.</span></strong></p>
<p><span >On Black Friday, many stores open very early in the morning and close late in the evening. In the past few years, the most anticipated Sale of the Year starts immediately after midnight and ends at midnight the next day, allowing shoppers</span><strong><span > to enjoy shopping all 24 hours.</span></strong><span > If you are fit, you can spend the whole day walking around the malls. In this case, you can take advantage of the best deals and discounts that are offered to customers on this day.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dqgeeepj5"><span >5. "Black Friday" - the day when truly strange events occur</span></h3>
<p><span >“Black Friday” always breaks records. below we will cover, why this day is the most popular among shopping enthusiasts. During the weekend of “Black Friday” in 2012, a record was set for the number of customers and the amount of money spent - </span><strong><span >247 million people went through all the stores, and the total amount spent on purchases amounted to almost $ 60 billion!</span></strong></p>
<p><span >Black Friday is known for many unpleasant incidents. Often on this day, people fight over goods, there were even cases when people shot at each other because in front of the store someone did not have enough free parking space. There are also incidents when people brought a gun, two knives, and a grenade to the store during Black Friday. Yes, indeed good discounts are expensive.</span></p>

                <p><span ><strong>Apple</strong> recently introduced its new product, Apple Card, which is a <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/types-of-credit-debit-cards-how-to-get-prepaid-visa-and-mastercard-cards.html">credit card</a> that can be accessed with or without a card. Apple is working with Goldman Sachs Bank for the credit card. Reporting from CNBC. The privilege of this card is that users can register through their iPhone and can directly access the card within minutes. </span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dq3b9kcc8"><span >Apple Credit Card 7 features you need to know.</span></h2>
<ol>
<li><span ><strong>Usage Credit Card: </strong>This card can be used through Apple Pay which has been operating since 2014. On its official page, Apple writes "Apple Card lives on your iPhone in a <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-create-your-money-making-mobile-application.html">digital wallet application</a>, and it makes new things possible. You can register at any time and can immediately start using it with Apple Pay. "</span></li>
<li><span ><strong>Titanium Card:</strong> If payment is not accepted by Apple Pay, there is a minimalist titanium card that looks slim. On that card, only your name is written without other personal information. For every payment, you get Daily Cash. </span></li>
<li><span ><strong>Schedule Fees: </strong>The card also allows users to manage expenses and rewards through the iPhone Wallet application. Apple ensures there are no fees, including late fees, international fees, or annual fees. "Even if you miss payments, we won't charge a penalty fee as most banks do," said Apple executive Jennifer Bailey.</span></li>
<li><strong><span >Transparency of Apple Credit Card:</span></strong><span > Apple's goal is to make customers easier to balance payments, rather than complicate things. It also heralded the simplicity and transparency of this card. For example, Apple will use maps and services to list purchase activities in a way that is easy to understand, instead of merchant codes that sometimes make credit card statements difficult to understand. Purchases are grouped in color-coded categories, such as food, entertainment, and others. Expenditure trends are also displayed for several weeks or months.</span></li>
<li><strong><span >Payment Options of Apple Credit Card: </span></strong><span >Payment options are displayed dynamically, so users can decide how fast users want to pay their bills. Annual interest rates will range from 13-24 percent.</span></li>
<li><strong><span >Privacy and Security of Apple Credit Card: </span></strong><span >Apple also emphasizes the aspects of privacy and security. The tech giant ensures that no one knows what you are buying, where you are buying it, or how much you are paying for it. It said the analysis for expenditures was carried out on devices, not on Apple servers. Goldman Sachs also will not sell purchase data to third parties. In addition, Apple Card uses a special security chip to store card numbers and every transaction has a one time password (OTP). The other layer of security also features a face identification and fingerprint scanner on the <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-migrate-from-iphone-to-android-and-android-to-iphone.html">iPhone</a>.</span></li>
<li><strong><span >Hardware, software, and services</span></strong><span >. Apple is uniquely positioned to make the most significant changes in the credit card experience in 50 years. Apple Pay is accepted by more than 70 percent of US retailers and will take effect in more than 40 countries by the end of the year. This service is expected to exceed 10 billion transactions this year.</span></li>

                <p><strong>Cortana</strong> has been present in the form of applications for <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/smartphones-2/" title="More Articles About SmartPhones ">Android</a> and iOS users in several countries. However, soon the digital assistant software will leave from both platforms. Cortana services for Android and iOS will be stopped from January 31, 2020.</p>
<p>The reason was revealed by Microsoft as the maker of Cortana in a statement on an <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4531683" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">official website</a>. "To make Cortana useful, we integrate Cortana into Microsoft 365 and part of this change is to stop supporting Cortana applications on Android and iOS," Microsoft wrote.</p>

<p><strong>Cortana</strong> for Android and iOS will be deactivated in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Later it was known that Germany, Mexico, China, and Spain would be affected. Nevertheless, it is still unclear what about Cortana's fate on Android and iOS devices in other regions, such as the United States. It is also not certain whether Cortana will also be turned off completely on Android and iOS or will continue to be used after January 31, 2020.</p>

<p><br>Microsoft first introduced Cortana for iOS and Android in 2015 to connect Windows 10 PCs with smartphones. Unfortunately, despite a number of an overhaul, Cortana still can not compete with competitors' digital assistants, such as Alexa or Google Assistant.</p>

                <p><span >Nowadays, users have preferred to use mobile devices to desktop PCs. Surfing on the Internet is one of the most popular activities for which it is not necessary to sit in front of a computer or laptop. People publish status on social networks and launch games through their phone.</span></p>
<p><span >In this context, using Android emulators to play mobile games or run an application on a computer may seem counterintuitive. But in fact, the number of people using Android emulators is increasing. Why? Let's look at <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/5-important-factors-to-consider-before-buying-a-speaker.html">5 reasons</a> why a user may need to use an Android Emulator on their PC.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dlbgjln70"><span >1. Android emulator gives you a bigger screen</span></h2>
<p><span >Keeping a close eye on your phone harms your eye. This is certainly not very good for your health. Moving from a small screen of a telephone to a large screen of a computer raises its head, also, the <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-fix-blue-screen-problem-of-microsoft-windows.html">large screen has a better display</a>. This greatly improves your accuracy when pressed in games.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dlbgjln81"><span >2. Saving the mobile phone battery</span></h2>
<p><span ><a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/take-photo-from-your-smartphone-and-earn-money.html">Cell phone</a> batteries are small and lightweight for portability, but this also means that they cannot last very long. Powerful games heat-up your phone and the battery runs down very quickly. No one wants to lose the battle because your phone is down and disconnected at the very last moment. Using the Android emulator, you never have to worry about power. You can watch videos or stay <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/5-best-smartphone-to-optimize-your-gaming-experience.html">connected in your favorite game</a> for as long as you need.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dlbgjln92"><span >3. Launch multiple applications or use multiple accounts at the same time.</span></h2>
<p><span >Imagine that you could watch a video in any video sharing application without interrupting your <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-use-whatsapp-without-a-phone-number.html">conversation on WhatsApp</a> or using multiple accounts for the game at the same time. That's fine, isn't it? Although not all Android emulators have this feature, with Nox App Player you can simultaneously run multiple instances of Android on your PC screen. Control your game in one of them, watch the video on the other and watch the conversation on WhatsApp on one big screen! </span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dlbgjln93"><span >4. The emulator allows you to replace the top-end Android phone</span></h2>
<p><span ><a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/tips-on-choosing-a-tablet-and-smartphone-to-play-games.html">Mobile games</a> are not just casual games. More and more hardcore games appear with a deep plot and complex gameplay. Accordingly, for a smooth and fast game, the graphics and display of the top device are required. The Android emulator will save you the budget to replace your phone since you can get for free this most “virtual, top-end Android phone” on your PC.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dlbgjln94"><span >5. Access to mobile applications from a PC</span></h2>
<p><span >With the growing number of smartphones and mobile networks, many applications meet the specific needs of people. However, some of them, such as Instagram, are designed to work only on mobile devices. For people who would like to access these services in a more “traditional” way from a PC, an Android emulator is a great solution.</span></p>
<p><span >So you want to try the Android emulator? Download Nox App Player to take full advantage of the benefits mentioned above.</span></p>

                <h1 id="mcetoc_1djdvj4vt0"> </h1>
<p><strong>Buying a speaker is certainly not the same as buying a smartphone.</strong></p>
<p><em>Why did it happen?</em></p>
<p><span >The reason is simple because in buying speakers, we must pay attention to <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/top-seven-tips-for-buying-a-gaming-computer.html">several important factors </a>such as the original sound quality of the speaker, type of speaker, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span >So, Today I am going to suggest you at least <strong>5 factors that are usually used by many experts before buying a speaker.</strong></span></p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1djdvj4vu1"><strong><span >1. Listen Sound Quality</span></strong></h4>
<p><span >Don't trust other people if the A or B speaker sounds good. Regardless of the popularity of those who say that the sound of a good speaker is different in every ear that hears it. Or in other words, the sound of the speaker is each individual's taste.</span></p>
<p><span >Therefore, when we want to buy a speaker, we have to directly listen to the sound produced by the speaker. </span></p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1djdvj4vv2"><strong><span >2. Pay Attention to Types of Speakers</span></strong></h4>
<p><span >Nowadays, there are many types of speakers that we can choose from various brands. </span></p>
<p><span >For the types of speakers, We know that there are several types such as </span><em><span >bookshelf speakers, soundbar speakers, floor-standing speakers, subwoofers</span></em><span > and many more. Here we must choose which one is suitable for us to use.</span></p>
<p><span >Suppose we want to use speakers on our PC or computer, then the type of speaker that usually matches a PC or computer is the type of </span><em><span >bookshelf speaker</span></em><span > or </span><em><span >soundbar speaker.</span></em></p>
<p><span >Then when we want to use the speakers on our television for entertainment purposes such as watching movies or karaoke with the family, the </span><em><span >floor-standing speaker</span></em><span > is the most appropriate.</span></p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1djdvj4vv3"><strong><span >3. The Room where the Speaker is used. </span></strong></h4>
<p><span >Not only the type of speaker and the sound of the speaker that must be considered, but the room where the speaker is used should also be taken into consideration. For example, a narrow room with an area of ​​6 x 5 square meters is not possible to use speakers with large sizes.</span></p>
<p><span >Similarly, in a room such as an auditorium, it is certainly not possible to use small </span><em><span >speakers</span></em><span > such as </span><em><span >bookshelf speakers</span></em><span > or </span><em><span >portable speakers.</span></em></p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1djdvj4vv4"><strong><span >4. Adjust to the Right Device</span></strong></h4>
<p><span >To present the maximum sound, a speaker must be paired with an </span><em><span >amplifier</span></em><span > or </span><em><span >receiver</span></em><span > that can deliver the appropriate </span><em><span >power.</span></em><span > For example, a speaker needs 30 - 100 Watts power to be able to work smoothly, the amplifier used must adjust to the speaker power.</span></p>
<p><span >Then when we want to make the speakers that we have </span><em><span >multi-channel</span></em><span > so that it can produce better sound. My recommendation is to pair the speakers that we have with other speakers of the same type and brand. Or if you want to be different, that's fine, but with my experience, it is best to pair the same brands. </span></p>

<h4 id="mcetoc_1djdvj4vv5"><strong><span >5. Speaker Optimization</span></strong></h4>
<p><span >This one might only be done after we install the speakers in the room. The first is to optimize the sound released by making arrangements such as </span><em><span >treble, bass,</span></em><span > and others.</span></p>
<p><span >Then the next is the position of the speakers that are placed is safe, comfortable and can guarantee to provide maximum performance? If not, it's better to reposition again. So, have a nice day. </span></p>

                <p>WhatsApp is a widespread text messaging, voice call and chat application used by many users around the world. WhatsApp Messenger is a complete messaging application that allows us to send text messages, photos, and media files for free. There are versions of WhatsApp for iPhone, BlackBerry, Android, <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-use-viber-for-windows-featured-some-interesting-updates-including-video-chats.html">Windows</a> Phone and Nokia, and these phones can save all your contact and chat data! WhatsApp uses the same Internet data transfer scheme that you use for email and web browsing. This allows you not to spend money on messages and stay in touch with friends.<br><br>Since many users use devices that do not have a SIM card like a mobile phone (such as a tablet or desktop PC), the problem is that in order to use WhatsApp without a phone number, you need to use one trick. It happens that you can not use your smartphone because of a breakdown. And although some service centers repair mobile phones at the client, troubleshooting can be delayed.<br><br><strong>Today we are going to show you how to use WhatsApp without a phone</strong> so that you can install and configure WhatsApp on a tablet or other device without a SIM card. Follow the manual to use this trick.<br><strong>Set up WhatsApp without using a phone number</strong><br>First, download the latest version of WhatsApp from the mobile app store. If you’re an old user, you can later restore WhatsApp chats to Google Drive. After the download is complete, install WhatsApp on your smartphone, tablet or PC, and then close it. Do not proceed to the next step.<br><br>Now you will need to enter a mobile phone number to which the application will send an SMS message with a verification code. On the Internet, there are several free <strong><a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/pinc-or-virtual-reality-for-your-iphone.html">virtual number registration services</a></strong> for verification in various online services. We note right away that most of them, in our case, will not work. Firstly, some services use the same number for everyone, and secondly, WhatsApp itself checks the validity of the number you enter. It is difficult to say exactly which parameters are evaluated by the messenger algorithm, but out of the few we entered, it accepted only the one that was obtained using the method described below.</p>
<p>So, in order to successfully verify the mobile phone number, you need to install an application called<strong> "Virtual SIM"</strong>. This must be done because the program will provide you with a virtual mobile phone number to which WhatsApp will send a confirmation code. After registering with WhatsApp, you can delete it. As a bonus, after installing Virtual SIM, you will receive 0.50 euros into your account, which you can use to make calls to any landline phones around the world.</p>
<p>Also read: <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-disable-the-built-in-browser-in-the-facebook-app-for-android.html">How disable built-in Facebook Browser in Smartphone</a>. <br><br>Further, everything is very simple. Open the WhatsApp application and as a phone number for verification, enter the number received in Virtual SIM and click continue. Now wait a few seconds and you will receive a verification code in the Virtual SIM application. Next, copy this code into WhatsApp.<br><br>After that, you can log into WhatsApp without a phone number.</p>

                <p>An ideal candidate should have a deep knowledge of the required <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/why-you-should-join-tefl-programs-in-spain.html">programming</a> language. However, it would be more valuable if he or she knew other coding languages to become more flexible and be able to work in future projects. It is also essential that developers have the ability to communicate effectively with all the members of the team and, in particular, with the customer to make sure that all the needs are understood at the beginning of each project thus saving development time and later changes. The software world is a fast paced, ever evolving environment and thus it is necessary to be able to meet very strict deadlines, be flexible and be creative. Furthermore, requirements often change during the <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/10-important-tips-to-place-a-good-web-design-course.html">course of large projects</a>, thus having experience in lean programming is essential. While establishing which are the desired skills of candidates is a relatively simple task, finding and especially evaluating such candidates before hiring them is particularly complex. It is easy to imagine how time consuming it would be to carry out some interviews and then perform technical tests where candidates show their qualities. In particular, this could become complicated because candidates may not be willing to code unpaid during an interview and evaluating some soft skills like team work is can be complicated unless certain people are in the interview. This can be difficult when everybody is busy with his or her own work.</p>
<p>Therefore, traditional methods to recruit candidates such as adverts in websites might be inadequate because it difficult or impossible to determine whether a candidate has the expertise and talent. It would appear interesting to be able to evaluate these important skills. As a result, hackathons have become an attractive option.</p>
<p><strong>What is hackathon?</strong> Hackathons are an original and effective way to find candidates for open tech positions by engaging hidden talents with coding competitions. During online challenges professionals can show off their skills and get hired. This way, organisations can discover &amp; recruit new talents, assess programming skills, improve time-to-hire, and source innovations.</p>
<p>Hackathons offer a unique environment for both recruiters and job seekers. Why? Recruiters can prepare specific problems of interest to different companies. For instance a group of companies could be interested in SAP or maybe in C++ whereas companies looking for web developers may prefer problems based on PHP.</p>

<p>Why would candidates attend to such an event? Hackathons, or coding competitions, are popular because of the rewards, which may or may not include a financial price. But usually, it is the prestige that attracts the most brilliant professionals, thus becoming a win-win situation for both recruiters and job-seekers.</p>
