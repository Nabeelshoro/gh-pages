                <span >Windows 7 is perhaps Microsoft's best operating system. No wonder it is so loved by users around the world. Although <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/microsoft-will-no-longer-support-windows-7.html">Microsoft ended the support in January 2020</a>, many users continue to use Windows 7 OS and are not even going to switch to Windows 10. </span><br><span >Let us leave the discussion of whether this is correct or not and focus on how to protect our windows 7 system that no longer receives security updates after January 2020.</span>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dvksd26r4"><span >How to continue to use the Windows 7 operating system without updates.</span></h2>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dvksbrmg0"><span >1. Install a reliable browser</span></h3>
<span >The old browser is the open door for many malicious programs, so this is the first thing you need to pay attention to. Along with the end of support for the operating system itself, updates will no longer come for Internet Explorer. Of course, few people use it, but be aware of use Internet Explorer in Old and expired OS, for example, Windows 7.</span><br><span >Fortunately, third-party browsers still support Windows 7 and are receiving updates. However, this will not last forever. Install any of the browsers: Chrome, Firefox or Opera.</span>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dvksbrmg1"><span >2. Install a third-party antivirus</span></h3>
<span >As with Internet Explorer, the standard antivirus will also stop receiving updates. This means that if you did not use a third-party antivirus relying solely on the built-in tools of the operating system, then it's time to install a third-party antivirus. </span><br><span >In an environment where the operating system is potentially vulnerable, it is better to play it safe. Moreover, this does not have to be a paid product.</span>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dvksbrmg2"><span >3. Do not use an administrator account</span></h3>
<span >Get a regular user account and use it for everyday tasks. This, of course, will affect usability, but your system will be a little safer. The fact is that if your account does not have rights to install programs, then viruses cannot be installed either. Roughly speaking, the system simply will not let the executable file run.</span>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dvksbrmg3"><span >4. Update or change unreliable software</span></h3>
<span >Programs in which there are loopholes for viruses are potentially no less dangerous than an outdated operating system. If you are still actively using some outdated software, such as Microsoft Office 2007, then update or change it. And in general, it is better to select programs carefully. Do not run unknown executable files and download them only from reliable sources.</span><br><span ><em><strong>Final Words:</strong></em> you need to understand that if you do not store anything important on a computer with Windows 7, regularly back up data, don’t pay by credit card online or your PC is not connected to the Internet at all, then the danger is minimized. Active users, in any case, are better off switching to Windows 10 or another current system.</span><br><strong><span >This is also interesting:</span></strong>

Otherwise, the company's suggestion is to purchase a new machine.</span><br><span >In practice, as it did a few years ago with popular Windows XP, the decision to stop upgrading the system will leave those who do not make the switch more vulnerable to potential viruses, trojans and hacker attacks.</span></p>
<p>According to December 2019 data, more than half of the world's computers use <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/windows-10/">Windows 10</a>.<br><span >The other 25 percent are Mac users, Linux users, some Windows XP fans who resist resisting it, and Windows 8 and 8.1, who has never been very popular with Microsoft customers.</span><br><span >According to the specialized press, the fundamental reason that explains the number of people who continue using Windows 7 is the general satisfaction of users with the system. The bad impression that some of them also got from Windows 10 is another pointed factor.</span><br><span >While it will no longer provide technical assistance for Windows 7 to the general, Microsoft will continue to support companies and government agencies that want to maintain the system and are willing to pay for it.</span></p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1dtq14em50">Facebook Smartphone Operating System as like Android</h2>
<p>According to the news - After <a href="https://theritetutorials.tech/huawei-appgallery-review-google-play-alternative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huawei</a>, another big technology giant may bring the competitor of the <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/personal-digital-assistant-cortana-will-leave-from-android-and-ios-beginning-2020.html">Android operating system</a>. Facebook. The company has hired software engineer Mark Lucovsky. The operating systems expert who worked on building Microsoft's Windows NT will be responsible for managing a team that will work to develop a new mobile operating system platform.</p>
<p>The upcoming<a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-disable-the-built-in-browser-in-the-facebook-app-for-android.html"> Facebook's</a> mobile operating system will be used in products developed by the company, such as the Oculus virtual reality display and the smart speaker Portal. Currently, both products are still dependent on Android.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure that the next generation has room for us,” said Andrew Bosworth, Facebook's vice president of hardware. “We cannot rely on the market or our competitors to make sure this will happen.”</p>
<p>Also, the plan is to create a platform that can more quickly integrate company-run services such as WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger, for example.</p>
<p>Remember that this is not the first time Zuckerberg's company has tried to create an operating system from scratch. In 2013, Facebook even ran a modified version of the Android platform on a hardware phone made by Chinese HTC. The product did not conquer the market and was soon abandoned.</p>

At the same time, it does not matter where the tourist is going - to Dubai or beyond the Arctic Circle.

<p><span >Such cases include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >forced hospital stay and hospitalization.</span></li>
<li><span >transfer of the victim to the nearest hospital or transportation to the country of residence.</span></li>
<li><span >fatal repatriation of the body</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >Where to buy an insurance policy for traveling abroad Today, travel insurance services are provided by most insurance companies accumulates their offers, allowing you to find out the most favorable prices for a specific request.

                <p id="mcetoc_1dscqp7jm0"><span >Going on a trip, you need to familiarize yourself with the features of the transport system of the country in which you plan to travel. After all, any situation leading to a violation, the travel plan can result in intangible losses of time and money. Therefore, it is so important to understand all major types of transport, especially such as taxis. Let's try to find out how the taxi service in Spain works.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dscqp7jo1"><span >Features of a taxi service in Spain.</span></h2>
<p><span >Spain remains a fairly developed country, in which all EU standards apply. And this means that using the services of a taxi, you have the right to count on compliance with safety standards, a satisfactory condition of the car and the mandatory presence of a meter.</span></p>
<p><span >The regions of Spain have their specifics, therefore, you will find a more comfortable trip than anywhere else in all EU.</span></p>
<p><span >An official taxi driver's license is not cheap and you need to go through many bureaucratic procedures to get it, so most Spanish taxi drivers value their workplace and are unlikely to risk their permission for a couple of extra euros.</span></p>
<p><span >As in most European countries, you can use taxi services in the country by placing an order by phone or using a mobile application or simply by catching it on the street. You can also use the services of cars parked in special parking lots.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dscqp7jo2"><span >How to order a taxi in Spain</span></h2>
<p><span >Walking through the streets of Spanish cities, you can see special taxi stands, which can be easily recognized by a blue rectangular sign with a white letter T. You can order a taxi directly at these stops, but certain rules must be observed.</span></p>
<p><span >Most importantly, always get in the car closest to the exit, as there is a sequence of drivers leaving the parking lot. If parking is not enough for everyone, then people with children, pregnant women, the elderly or disabled are the first to get into them.</span></p>
<p><span >You can catch a free car, as in most countries of the world, with a wave of your hand, but keep in mind that the driver is not entitled to pick up a passenger within a radius of 50 meters from the parking lot.</span></p>
<p><span >The fact that the car is free is signaled by a panel with a glowing green light and the sign on the roof of the car. Therefore, it would be most reasonable to book a transfer from the airport to the hotel in advance.</span></p>
<p><span >Finally, you can always ask to call you a car at the reception of your hotel: however, the reasonableness of the prices of the company whose services you are offered to use will remain solely on the conscience of the hotel staff.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dscqp7jo3"><span >Taxi rates in Spain</span></h2>
<p><span >The cost of your trip will depend on many factors, among which the main ones are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >a region in which the trip takes place;</span></li>
<li><span >base rate;</span></li>
<li><span >distance;</span></li>
<li><span >Times of Day;</span></li>
<li><span >car class;</span></li>
<li><span >additional services (child car seat, luggage, etc.).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >Sometimes you will have to pay extra for entry into the territory of airports, seaports, railway stations, and some other facilities. The cost of the trip can also increase due to standing in traffic jams.</span></p>
<p><span >The most popular brand of taxi cars in almost the whole country is the Taxi2Spain, and specilly in <a href="https://taxi2spain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Madrid transfer</a>.</span><span >You can find the additional feature of taxi2spain by visiting their website here taxi2spain.com.</span></p>

<p><span >As mentioned above, the loss of a license is a nightmare of taxi drivers, so there is no reason to expect obvious fraud from them because only one complaint from a passenger can cost them a career. </span></p>
<p><span >The best way is to write your destination in large letters on a piece of paper (or a mobile phone screen) in advance and show the driver when landing. If you order a taxi in advance, for example, using the Taxi2Spain service that works perfectly in Spain, then such misunderstandings will not happen at all.</span></p>
<p><span >Taxi rules in Spain are quite liberal but stricter. You can stop the car on the road almost everywhere except airports, but smoking in the passenger compartment is strictly forbidden, and you have every right to refuse to get into the vehicle passenger compartment while intoxicated.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dscqp7jo5"><span >Finally</span></h2>
<p><span >Spain has a developed and reliable taxi system. Using a taxi in Spain is practically safe, as their work is regulated by the state. Taxis operate at rates that are also determined by the state. However, they may vary slightly depending on the region. Besides, it should be noted that at night, as well as on holidays and weekends, tariffs are higher.</span></p>
<p><span >Keep in mind that not all taxi drivers in Spain speak English, so if you do not know Spanish, you should have a business card or address of your final destination with you. have a nice trip to Spain.</span></p>

                <p id="mcetoc_1dsa2u5pe0">In this article, we will guide you on How to check the brand for Vegan Cosmetics and which components should not be included</p>
<p><span >In the past few years, the popularity of brands that do not test their products on animals is growing rapidly. A study by Grand View Research showed that by 2025 the market for Vegan Cosmetics will reach $ 20.8 billion. The average annual growth rate for sales of vegan cosmetics is 6.3%. A great interest in vegan cosmetics is primarily among millennials. The reason for the growing interest in this niche was the desire of people to take care of personal health and the environment.</span></p>
<p><span >Often, ideas about vegan cosmetics are wrong. Many people think that this is only cruelty-free, but not only the ban on testing cosmetic products on animals is important here, but also the complete exclusion from the composition of products of animal origin, for example, beeswax, lanolin, and colored carmine pigment.</span></p>
<p><span >Another misconception is that vegan foods do not contain synthetic ingredients and chemicals. This is not true. Vegan brands include both herbal ingredients and synthetic ones for preservation or texture uniformity.</span></p>
<p>Related: <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-find-a-perfect-developer-for-you-company.html">How to find a perfect developer for your company?</a></p>
<p><span >The phrase "vegan makeup" can cause bewilderment and even distrust. But thanks to modern technology, vegan brands are not inferior in quality and variety to others. “A few years ago, I would agree that there would be a loss in variety when choosing vegan makeup products, But the technologies and compositions improved beyond recognition.”</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dsa33mmo2"><span >How to check a best vegan brand?</span></h2>
<p><span >First, a complete list of cosmetic ingredients that are not suitable for vegans can be found on arolaborganic.com/en. Secondly, a list of best vegan brands is available at <a href="https://www.arolaborganic.com/en/" title="Vegan Beauty best website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vegan beauty</a>. On the packaging of cosmetics and this website of the brand have <a href="https://www.arolaborganic.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arolab</a>, not tested on animals. You can also check the brand through the above website.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dsa3j4cja"><strong><span >Ingredients that should not be in the composition. </span></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><span >Beeswax - may be designated as Cera alba or cera Flava</span></li>
<li><span >Carmine is a red dye derived from carmine acid, which is produced by female cochineal insects. May be labeled as carmine acid.</span></li>
<li><span >Lanolin - wool wax, animal wax obtained by digesting sheep wool. May be referred to as aliphatic alcohols, isopropyl lanceolate, planet, lanolin, lanolin alcohols, lanosterols, sterols or triterpene alcohols.</span></li>
<li><span >Glycerin - it is obtained by the saponification of animal fats. It can be found in the composition as the glyceride, glyceryl, glycret-26 or polyglycerol.</span></li>
<li><span >Honey - apis mellifera is sometimes noted.</span></li>
<li><span >Fish scales - used in cosmetics for a flicker effect. It is marked as guanine, CI 75170 or natural pearl essence.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >There are controversial components, both animal origin and derived from plants. These are elastin, keratin, and squalane. In such cases, the “veganism” of the brand is better specified using the above sources.</span></p>

                <p><span >The developers of the <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/ten-things-you-did-not-know-about-whatsapp.html">WhatsApp messenger</a> in the year 2020 refuse to support old mobile operating systems. <strong>In this article, we will guide you on which smartphones will not support WhatsApp?</strong> if you are still using bellow listed Smartphones then it is confirmed that your WhatsApp will not work and it might be banned.</span></p>
<p><span >The process of banning the old operating system smartphones has two stages.<strong> First,</strong> starting January 1, 2020, WhatsApp will stop working on all Windows Phone devices. And <strong>Second</strong>, from February 1, 2020, the <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/3-tips-to-avoid-malicious-malware-from-whatsapp.html">WhatsApp</a> messenger will not work on smartphones with Android 2.3.7 and iOS 8.</span></p>
<p><span >Here is the Complete list of Smartphones that will not be supported by WhatsApp in the year 2020.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span >Windows phone</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span >Starting January 2020, WhatsApp refuses all smartphones with Windows Phone operating system - up to the latest 8.1. These are almost all smartphones until the 2014 release. These are mainly Lumia smartphones, which were manufactured by Nokia in partnership with Microsoft.</span></p>
<p><span >Popular smartphones on <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/10-best-email-clients-for-windows-paid-and-free.html">Windows</a> Phone that will lose WhatsApp are Lumia 520, 525, 620, 625, 630, 720, 820, 920, 925, 1020, 1320. For some smartphones from this list, it is possible to install a test or unofficial build of Windows 10 Mobile, but often this firmware is unstable. </span></p>
<p><span >But WhatsApp will continue to work on all smartphones that have upgraded to <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/windows-10-new-features.html">Windows 10</a> Mobile. But Microsoft itself has already closed support for this operating system, so the messenger on these smartphones will last at best a couple more years.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iPhone</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span >WhatsApp will not work in <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/apple-card-a-credit-card-embedded-in-the-iphone.html">iPhone 4</a> and older models. That is all Apple smartphones that came out before 2011.</span></p>
<p><span >If iPhone 4S, for example, received an update to iOS 9, so WhatsApp will still work on it. As with all newer Apple smartphones.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Android</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span >From February 2020, WhatsApp will no longer support all smartphones on Android 2.3.7 and older. Dozens of models that came out between 2009-2011 will be banned. Now Android 2.3 and its variations occupy a share of 0.3% of all active smartphones on Android - taking into account the total number of devices, it is about 7.5 million smartphones worldwide.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1ds7qllq30"><span >list of Andriod smartphones which will be banned of WhatsApp: </span></h2>
<p><span >WhatsApp will stop working on the first Samsung Galaxy S, Galaxy Mini, Galaxy Gio, Google Nexus One, Sony Ericsson Xperia X10, Sony Ericsson Xperia Play, LG Optimus One, HTC Wildfire S, HTC Desire, HTC Desire HD, HTC Desire Z and many other smartphones that have not updated to Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1ds7qm2pk1"><span >How to use WhatsApp in old smartphones?</span></h3>
<p><span >So, what should we do next? </span><span >Yes, the answer is we can use WhatsApp in old Smartphones if we install unofficial firmware of Android 4.0 or newer. but hurry up install it before February 2020.</span></p>
<p><span >To simplify, WhatsApp support will lose the old smartphones that came out before 2011.</span></p>

                The new year 2020 is getting closer. Users of the <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/you-can-try-the-explore-section-in-the-web-version-of-facebook.html">Facebook</a> Messenger application often send new year's wishes to others, at the moment of the new year Facebook Messenger users feel difficulty to send new year wishes to their friends and relatives. As many as 1.3 billion Messenger users are known to send more messages on New Year's Eve moments, compared to normal days. Not only text messages, but the intensity of sending photos and videos has also increased many times compared to other days. <br> In this article, we will guide you on how to prevent server overload and Message sending failed problem in Facebook Messenger on new year's eve. <br>Well, related to the <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-use-fb-messenger-in-web-browser.html">Messenger application</a>, Facebook has its way to handle huge traffic of messages sent simultaneously during New Year's Eve, so that the server is not broken, or unable to serve traffic. Knowing this, Messenger technicians also made several steps to handle traffic in the application, ahead of New Year's Eve. Here are some ways that sending messages easily in the Messenger application. <br><br>
<ol>
<li><strong>Test the server load:</strong> The technicians do server load testing. Before the New Year's Eve, Facebook had already made a simulation by sending several messages that would be received to fellow Messenger users. From here, you can see whether this time the server's ability to handle the traffic flow of the message or not. If you can't, then the allocation of messages that appear to be booming will be transferred to another server. This technique is the same as that done by the Messenger last year. On New Year's Eve 2018, the Messenger team provided an additional server to divert incoming messages to the chat application to prevent overloading on the server.</li>
<li><strong>Low-Priority Mode:</strong> Facebook has created a mechanism of "low-priority" to prevent the booming of messages that could make the server overload due to being sent simultaneously. "We have set up our system, if the server is dense, the system will start to divert traffic to low-priority mode," said Isaac Ahdout, Engineering Manager for Facebook Messenger. This low-priority mechanism will prioritize the messages sent so that they get to other users quickly.  The way this system works is by making priorities, sorting and choosing which features will be "turned off" first, to reduce server pressure and burden. For example, the read receipt feature, or a message alert that has been read, will be temporarily deactivated to increase resource allocation for messages to be sent. Then the Messenger technician can also turn off the "online" green circle, which helps ease the server load. Another example, Messenger will suspend detailed information about old messages for a while, to ease the server's CPU load. Thus, messages that go in and out will be prioritized first so they can be received quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduler Feature:</strong> Messenger technicians work on a project called "scheduler". This scheduler allows the system to unify several messages whose contents are similar. Later, integration with the principle of "affinity" will ease the burden on the server, because similar messages will be sent as a group. This process, according to Isacc, will ease the CPU load, because the server receives the message sending request process only once for many collections of messages, rather than having to send it one at a time as a process.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also read: <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null">How to disable the built-in Browser in the Facebook App in the Android </a></p>
<p><strong>As a result,</strong> server latency will be reduced by a few milliseconds, so that all messages can be sent smoothly. Facebook servers are still able to handle the swirling billions of users who send messages through the application. <br> However, if the Messenger server is oversupplied due to being crammed with messages simultaneously, then one of the three things will be an alternative solution to ease the burden on the server. Plus, some technicians were on standby in several places to be ready to activate the solution related to problems that might occur ahead of the new year's eve of 2020.</p>
