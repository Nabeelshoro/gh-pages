                FaceBook's new audio calling App CatchUp offers simple calls, like in the days of regular phones. At the same time, users themselves indicate their willingness to talk<br><br>Facebook’s NPE Team Experimenters New Voice Calling App CatchUp Its feature is that it shows users when subscribers are ready to communicate.<br><a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/facebook-wants-you-to-share-more-music-on-your-network-with-music-stories.html">Facebook</a> knows the importance of communication, especially now that the world is facing a difficult situation. People are forced to stay at home, therefore, by any means maintain contact with each other. In this regard, new calling application CatchUp will be an excellent assistant, since the program offers simple calls - such as during the time of conventional push-button phones. According to studies, one of the main reasons people don’t call friends, relatives, and friends more often is that they don’t know when they are ready to talk to them. Often people worry that they can call at an uncomfortable time. but CatchUp solves this problem.
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e9lo9c7v0">Important features of CatchUp Application.</h2>
In the CatchUp application, users can indicate that they are ready for a conversation by setting the appropriate status. It will be visible to all other participants. In addition to individual calls, CatchUp also has group calls, which are easy to join. The program is not related to the Facebook application, so users do not need to have a social network account. Linking is carried out by phone number, as in any other messenger, so you can even chat with those who do not have a Facebook account.<br>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e9lo9p321">How to use CatchUp Application.</h2>
<p>CatchUp is currently being tested in the US on iOS and Android. Since this is an experimental product, I hope Facebook will release and updates all over the world as soon as possible.</p>

                    <img src="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/media/posts/207/voice-search-1792301_640.png" alt="How to set up Google Assistant on Android with Action Block" />
                <p><span >I love Google Assistant and use it regularly. Unlike Siri on iOS, the voice assistant of the Google Assistant is more deeply integrated with Android and allows you to interact with the operating system with great convenience. You can ask him to translate the text, find the right product on the Internet from a photograph, read out the contents of the website, return the application that was mistakenly bought on Google Play, not to mention controlling music playback, setting alarms, and more. However, because it was possible to manage the Google Assistant only by voice or through correspondence, many avoided using it, hesitating to contact their phone. It’s good that Google understood this.</span></p>
<p><span >Google has launched the Action Blocks app for Android. It allows you to create a kind of shortcut for the Google Assistant quick commands that you can place on your desktop and activate the necessary actions without speaking to the assistant by voice. That is Action Blocks is an analog of Siri Shortcuts on iOS, and its key difference from the proprietary Apple application is a less extensive set of functions, although Google Assistant itself will be more capable than Siri. However, the purpose of Action Blocks is a bit different.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e90sme1a0"><span >How Google Assistant with Action block Quick Commands Work</span></h2>
<p><span >The goal of Action Blocks is not to expand the capabilities of the device, like Siri Shortcuts, which adds functionality to the device but to simplify the interaction with it. Suppose, earlier, to set the alarm, you should first call the assistant, then say the appropriate command, set the time, check whether he understood you correctly, and only then confirm the action. With Action Blocks, you can make Google Assistant remember the action you need, save it, and you just click on the shortcut on the desktop to activate it.</span></p>
<p>Read: <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/5-useful-google-chrome-browser-features-you-need-to-know.html">5 useful Google Chrome browser feature </a></p>
<p><span >While the Action Blocks application is available only in English, which, however, will not prevent you from downloading it. At the time of publication, the development is already available in the Russian segment of the Google Play catalog and is distributed free of charge. Well, to make it easier for you to understand the features of the program and configure everything the way you want, although its interface is as simple and logical as possible, I offer you this short instruction.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e90sme1b1"><span >How to create a quick command for Google Assistant using Action Block Application</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span >Download Action Block on your smartphone and activate it;</span></li>
<li><span >Click Create Action Block to create a shortcut with the command;</span></li>
<li><span >Select a command from the proposed ones or click Create custom action to create your own;</span></li>
<li><span >Click on the microphone icon and say a command with your voice or write it on the keyboard;</span></li>
<li><span >Click Test action to make sure that Google Assistant correctly recognized the command;</span></li>
<li><span >Select an icon for a shortcut with a quick command and name it;</span></li>
<li><span >Save the quick command and place it on your desktop.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >In my opinion, Action Blocks could be a decisive factor in favor of promoting Google Assistant. Not only that, thanks to the shortcuts with quick commands, the assistant will be able to use those who were embarrassed to use their smartphone's voice, but they will also help facilitate the use of older people. Practice shows that most users of advanced age interact with their smartphones only within a certain functional circle. However, with shortcuts, they can do much more without having to remember ways to activate certain features.</span></p>

                <p><span >We go to dozens of sites every day, this is called "web surfing." In this article, let's understand how sites work, and what does web hosting have to do with it.</span></p>
<p><span >When you need to go to any site, we open a browser and write the name of the site, or rather a <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/earning-money-from-domain-parking-basic-ideas.html">domain name</a>. It consists of the name and designation of the domain zone, for example, the domain "thetrickspeak.com" refers to the zone "global". Next, the browser needs to convert the alphabetic name to the digital address of the site - IP (Internet Protocol). Text names were invented for the convenience of using the Internet, but in reality, only digital IP addresses are “under the hood”.</span></p>
<p><span >For mapping domains with IPs, a global database of Domain Name System (DNS) names is used.</span></p>
<p><span >When the IP is found, the browser accesses this address and starts <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/3-free-ways-to-download-youtube-videos.html">downloading</a> the site files. These files must be stored somewhere, this place is called web hosting. That is, hosting is a place on the Internet, the server where the site “lives”. Web hosting is provided by hosting providers. The stability of work and the speed of loading the site directly depend on the quality of the hosting. Hosting service is paid, and prices vary depending on requirements, from $ 1 per month. There are thousands of providers now, so it’s better to understand factors before buying any hosting for your website.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e8f6nnv40"><span >Hosting Features</span></h2>
<p><span ><a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/web-hosting-solution-for-small-business.html">Hosting</a> not only contains site files, but it is also a complex system that includes several basic modules:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >Name Server (DNS).</span></li>
<li><span >File storage.</span></li>
<li><span >Programming language handlers.</span></li>
<li><span >Database servers.</span></li>
<li><span >Backup system.</span></li>
<li><span >HTTP server.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >The name server stores a database of domains and IP addresses. These databases are synchronized with each other and, theoretically, the same database on all hosting sites. Your ISP has the same database.</span></p>
<p><span >The file server provides disk space. There are several basic file types used for the site:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >HTML is the source code of the page that is loaded into the browser.</span></li>
<li><span >PHP - code in the programming language PHP.</span></li>
<li><span >CSS - styles for visualizing content.</span></li>
<li><span >JS - code in the Javascript programming language.</span></li>
<li><span >JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP - pictures, photos.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >You can, of course, store any files, but the described types are used on most pages on the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span >On the Internet, some sites were static. This means that the hosting kept ready-made files that the browser simply downloaded and rendered the page. Now the sites are dynamic, i.e. the finished HTML file does not lie on the server, but it needs to be generated. This happened because there were content management systems (CMS), for example, WordPress.</span></p>
<p><span >CMS uses programming languages ​​and databases. Different information is stored across dozens of tables in the database. With the help of a code, information is collected according to a given algorithm and a page is formed.</span></p>
<p><span >Thus, you can generate millions of pages, and you do not need to store HTML files for each. But most importantly, it is easy to change something immediately on all pages of the site. Web hosting can interpret code in programming languages. The most popular are PHP, Perl, Python, ASP.NET, node.js. When choosing a hosting, pay attention above things</span></p>
<p><span >The HTTP server accepts the connection from the browser and gives the files. If the page is static, then the HTTP server simply downloads the HTML file, and if it is dynamic, it will first transfer control to the interpreter and then take the HTML code from it. Hosting ability to process a large number of connections, i.e. visitors, depends on the HTTP server.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e8f6nnv51"><span >Types of Hosting</span></h2>
<p><span >The described model is called "Shared hosting", also called virtual or private. With shared hosting, a site is allocated disk space and a processor time limit for processing commands. As a rule, this limit is small, since hundreds of sites use one server, hence the name - “common”. This is the most inexpensive and common type of hosting.</span></p>
<p><span >Shared hosting has disadvantages:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >Limited computing resources.</span></li>
<li><span >You can not change the software environment.</span></li>
<li><span >Server settings are very limited.</span></li>
<li><span >The security of all sites is interconnected.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >But there are advantages:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >Low cost.</span></li>
<li><span >Everything works out of the box.</span></li>
<li><span >Server administration is entirely in the hands of technical support.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >Serious web owner does not use shared hosting, although large content resources may remain here. In fact, shared hosting can withstand impressive traffic if you turn a dynamic site into a static one.</span></p>
<p><span >Caching plugins are used for this. It works simply: the first time you access the page, it, as expected, is generated by the engine from scratch. Then, the finished page is saved to an HTML file on disk, and the next time the hosting gives a static file.</span></p>
<p><span ><a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/web-hosting-solution-for-small-business.html">Shared hosting</a> does not guarantee a processor resource, and it is not measured at all. Some hosters have come up with an internal processor unit, such as 50 CPUs. The number does not allow you to somehow evaluate the load capacity of the server, but in this way, you can compare tariffs among themselves. This gives an understanding that a more expensive tariff is not only distinguished by available disk space, but also by an increased limit on the processor.</span></p>
<p><span >For guaranteed power they use virtual private servers - VPS / VDS. In this case, you get not just disk space for the site, but your own server. This means that you have your own operating system. On the OS, you can put any modules, programming languages, HTTP-servers, and databases. </span></p>
<p><span >There can be some analogy between VPS and Shared: instead of a piece of disk space, you get a piece of the server. One real server is divided into dozens of virtual servers. Guaranteed resources are determined by the VPS parameters:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >The processor clock speed in MHz, for example, 2900 MHz.</span></li>
<li><span >The number of processor cores: from 1 to 32 and above.</span></li>
<li><span >The amount of RAM.</span></li>
<li><span >Disk space</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >VPS hosting launches online stores and services. If you need a complete server, then this is called a dedicated server rental. A physical server passes to your control, on which you can install your OS.</span></p>
<p><span >Unlike Shared, a dedicated server needs to be independently administered, to monitor health and safety. If at night the server freezes and the site stops working, then only you are responsible for this. In the case of Shared hosting, technical support will see that the server crashed and restore its operation.</span></p>
<p><span >Hosting is used not only for websites, but it is also a remote server to run applications. Sites run on Linux, programs run on Microsoft Windows. Conveniently, the servers work 24 hours a day, do not make noise, and do not take up space in the room. On a remote server, you can run a program that should work without interruption, and not require large processing power. For example, Windows hosting is used for the work of exchange robots.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e8f6nnv52"><span >Conclusions</span></h2>
<p><span >You need to carefully approach the choice of hosting provider services to host the site. After reviewing the available information, you can choose what the user needs in a particular situation: shared hosting or a VPS / VDS server. Both types of hosting have their pros and cons, choose what suits you best.</span></p>

                <p><span >Often there are situations when you need to transfer information from a phone to a computer - be it text, video, or file. You can use the USB-wire, which will quickly transmit information. But what to do when there is no wire? I talk about 5 alternative methods of transfer files from phone to computer without a USB cable.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e801u9md0"><span >Email</span></h2>
<p><span >This is a very easy way to transfer files. It is enough to have even one email address to transfer files. But, there are some restrictions - 10 GB. Files larger than 25 MB will be uploaded to the cloud.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e801u9me1"><span >Instant messengers</span></h2>
<p><span >As a rule, instant messengers have a web version or a desktop client. In the case of WhatsApp, you can use</span><strong><span > the web version</span></strong><span >. I recommend downloading for Telegram </span><strong><span >desktop version</span></strong><span >. But still, there are size restrictions. For WhatsApp, this is 16 MB for photos and 100 MB for files. Telegram has more loyal limits - 1.5 GB for all file types.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e801u9mf2"><span >Cloud</span></h2>
<p><span >There are a large number of cloud services. Almost all of them have a mobile application, so it’s convenient to upload files there and download them from your smartphone. Limits for the most popular cloud services:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >Google Cloud - from 50 Mb to 5 Tb</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e801u9mf3"><span >FTP Transfer</span></h2>
<p><span >This method is very interesting. Unlike the method above, it does not have any limits, but you need to at least have a minimum understanding of phones and computers. The plus is also that you do not need to use traffic since you do not need to publish and then download the file.</span></p>
<p><span >First, you need to download </span><strong><span >ES File Explorer</span></strong><span > and connect to the same Wi-Fi network. After that, in the explorer in the side menu, select the network -&gt; View on PC. There will be a line similar to ftp://192.168.1.6:3721/. Enter it on the computer in the search menu. And here they are, all the files in front of you:</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e801u9mf4"><strong><span >Shareit</span></strong></h2>
<p><span >A very simple method. You need to install the ShareIt program on the phone and computer. After that, send the file on the phone and accept it on the computer. Using the internet is optional.</span></p>

                <p><span >Basic settings regarding the operation of equipment and accessories are stored in the BIOS. You can get to this menu when you boot your <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/computer-tips-and-tricks/">computer or laptop</a>. Usually, you need to hold the Del key while turning on the PC. Notebooks, as well as other brand assemblies, may have a different key. For example, there are options with F1, F2, F10. In any case, the key can be indicated on the loading screen, as well as in the instructions. In addition, it is worth looking for information on the official website of the manufacturer.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e7is5at20"><span >Why reset</span></h2>
<p><span >Resetting is required if you did something wrong and the computer does not start or is unstable. Often this happens when components are improperly dispersed. For example, you can try resetting the BIOS if the computer does not boot after changing any settings. And even when the system starts normally, errors and crashes to the blue screen can occur under load.</span></p>
<p><span >Moreover, by resetting the BIOS, you can remove the previously set password if you forget it. This refers to the password set specifically in the BIOS, and not in Windows.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e7is5at31"><span >What happens if you reset the BIOS</span></h2>
<p><span >Simply put, when you reset the BIOS, nothing bad will happen. However, you need to understand that the settings will return to the factory state, which may affect the operation of the entire system. For example, you will lose the overclocking of components. This includes at least the frequency of the processor and RAM.</span></p>

<p><span >There are many ways to reset the BIOS, the easiest of which is software. This is done from the settings and therefore the computer should turn on. Also, this method will not work if there is a password and you do not remember it. Depending on the BIOS version, the name of the item in the settings may differ. Therefore, you should at least be a little familiar with how this works. You need to search for items with names: Load Optimized Defaults, Load Setup Defaults.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e7is5at43"><span >Battery</span></h2>
<p><span >In addition, you can reset the settings in a physical way. First of all, and it is much simpler, you should remove the battery power memory to store settings. This same battery allows the computer to display the correct time. </span></p>
<p><span >It is located on the motherboard both in a stationary computer and on a laptop. In the latter case, you have to disassemble the laptop, which may void your warranty. The same applies to branded desktops, if the warranty seal is on the case, then you can not open it.</span></p>
<p><span >Before removing the battery, disconnect the system unit, remove the laptop battery. Remove the battery and wait a few minutes before returning it to its place. Please note that the battery may be non-removable.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e7is5at44"><span >Jumper to reset</span></h2>
<p><span >Another way is connected with a special jumper located on the motherboard. Before performing the operation, be sure to turn off the power supply, using the switch on its case. In addition, the battery is also worth removing.</span></p>
<p><span >Typically, a jumper is located next to the battery. There is no standard name for it. Designations can be: CLRTC, Clear CMOS, Reset CMOS, as well as various combinations and abbreviations of these words. Physically, the jumper looks like two or three-pin contacts. In the first case, they just need to be closed, for example, with a screwdriver. However, it is better to do this with the so-called jumper. It can be taken from another place on the motherboard, and put back after use. In the second case, the jumper is already present and connects two of the three contacts. It needs to be rearranged to the second position.</span></p>
<p><span >Keep the contacts closed for 10-15 seconds and then put everything back. If this option does not work, then with the contacts closed, hold down the power button on the case and hold it for the same 10-15 seconds. After that, you may need to leave the board in this state for 15 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span >Also on the motherboard, there may be a separate button to reset the settings. If it is present, then fiddling with jumpers is no longer necessary. It will be enough to hold it for 5-10 seconds with the power off.</span></p>

                <p><span >Work from home by someone has long been perceived as a dream. But everyone was sent to a remote place and it turned out that fulfilling duties while sitting in a favorite chair is not so simple. <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/frontpage/1">The Tricks Peak</a> has put together applications that will make your Home office life easier.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e76kverj0"><span >1. Trello </span></h2>
<p><strong> Purpose: task manager </strong></p>
<p><span ><a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Website</a></span><span >, </span><span ><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/trello/id461504587" rel="nofollow">iOS</a></span><span >, </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trello" rel="nofollow">Android </a></p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/media/posts/203/Trello-Purpose-task-manager.jpg" alt="" width="1438" height="530"></p>
<p><span >Trello is an application for project management. It allows you to organize teamwork - it is easier for employees to report to the head of your work, and the main thing is easier to monitor what tasks workers performed. </span></p>
<p><span >The head creates the columns, employee cards. Depending on the state of the task, the card moves from one column to another. </span></p>
<p><span >Conventionally, Trello has three columns: ideas, in progress, and delivered. The employee proposed a new logo for the client company, which means he creates the corresponding card in the “ideas” column. The manager accepts it and transfers the card to the “in progress” column. At the end of the day, the employee passes the logo. The manager has no complaints, so the card is transferred to the column “delivered”. </span></p>
<p><span >It would seem that everything is simple in Trello. But the company has more than one employee, and everyone can’t keep track of it. And in Trello, the leader can see the team’s work and which projects are ready and which ones to expect in the near future. </span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e76l00ne1"><span >2. Asana </span></h2>
<p><strong>Purpose: task manager </strong></p>
<p><span ><a href="https://asana.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Website</a></span><span >, </span><span ><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/asana-organize-tasks-work/id489969512" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">iOS</a></span><span >, </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asana.app" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Android  </a></p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/media/posts/203/Asana-Purpose-task-manager.jpg" alt="" width="1675" height="520"></p>
<p><span >Alternative to Trello. Asana is a more complex but more versatile task manager. First of all, here you can choose the type of project - board, list, timeline, calendar. </span></p>
<p><span >Further, the essence is the same - you add sections (the same columns) and tasks (the same cards). For example, these are the same “ideas”, “in progress” and “delivered”. The proposed task is added to the "ideas". If the manager accepts it, the task moves to the "in progress" section. At the end of the day, the employee performs the task. The manager has no complaints, and the card is transferred to the "delivered" section.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e76l0aif2"><span >3. Ticktick</span></h2>
<p><strong>Pupose: time control </strong></p>
<p><span ><a href="https://ticktick.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Website</a></span><span >, </span><span ><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/tick-tick/id626144601" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">iOS</a></span><span >, </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ticktick.task" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Android  </a></p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/media/posts/203/Ticktick-Pupose-time-control.jpg" alt="" width="1710" height="635"></p>
<p><span >This service allows you to monitor completed tasks and monitor the implementation of the daily plan. </span></p>
<p><span >The principle of operation is as follows. You create tasks, they, in turn, are divided into lists. If in one list all the tasks are completed, then you achieve the goal. It turns out a kind of game. </span></p>
<p><span >Conditionally, you have created three lists: the main project, secondary tasks, the second job. In the main project, you have three tasks. Once you complete them, the goal is considered complete.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e76l0ije3"><span >4. Zoom </span></h2>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong><span ><strong> video conferencing </strong> </span></p>
<p><span ><a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Website</a></span><span >, </span><span ><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id546505307" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">iOS</a></span><span >, </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.zoom.videomeetings" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Android </a></p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/media/posts/203/Zoom.jpg" alt="" width="1661" height="510"></p>
<p><span >Optimal service for video chats. Skype is a thing of the past, and FaceTime is only available on Apple devices. Zoom allows you to create a conference for up to 100 participants. In it, one person is endowed with the rights of the organizer, he has the opportunity to invite and remove interlocutors. </span></p>
<p><span >However, the free version is not without limitations. In it, you can conduct a conference for up to 40 minutes. The restriction is removed in the paid version. In addition, in it, you can vest the rights of administrators of other conference participants. </span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e76l0qa44"><span >5. Slack </span></h2>
<p><strong>Purpose: communication </strong></p>
<p><span ><a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Website</a></span><span >, </span><span ><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/slack/id618783545" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">iOS</a></span><span >, </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Slack" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Android </a></p>
<p><span >Corporate messenger. Replaces a number of services for communication and file transfer - Skype, mail, other instant messengers, cloud storage. </span></p>
<p><span >Slack feature - synchronization with other services like Google Drive, Google Docs, Twitter, Trello, Hangouts, Dropbox, GitHub, and others. The messenger is free, but there are also paid tariffs, they increase the number of saved messages and the amount of cloud storage. </span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e76l16rl5"><span >6. Toggl</span></h2>
<p><strong>Appointment: time control </strong></p>
<p><span ><a href="https://toggl.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Website</a></span><span >, </span><span ><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/toggl-time-tracker-for-work/id1291898086" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">iOS</a></span><span >, </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toggl.giskard" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span >Android</span></a></p>
<p><span >Application for time management. You will see how many hours you spend on various tasks. Toggl can look different: as a web version, a utility for a computer, or a mobile application for iOS and Android. </span></p>
<p><span >Working with the application is simple: specify the title of the task, write the name of the project to which this task belongs, and start the timer. Once done, stop the timer. And if you are distracted, also click “stop” so that the tracker fixes it. Thus, you will get a list of tasks that you perform in a day. The main thing is not to forget to turn the tracker on or off. To do this, turn on reminders: then the application will remind you of itself, asking if you forgot to turn the tracker on or off. </span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e76l1iie6"><span >7. Teamweek </span></h2>
<p><strong>Purpose: control of the time of all team </strong></p>
<p><span ><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/teamweek/id1242738862" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">iOS</a></span><span >, </span><span ><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamweek.android.app" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Android</a></span><span > </span></p>
<p><span >Teamweek allows the team to maintain a common calendar to visually plan the time of each employee and see who is busy and who is free at a particular moment.</span></p>
<p><span >Tasks can be created and scheduled on the timeline. The team can be divided into groups, for each set its own time frame. Users can view tasks, filter them by project, view the team calendar in the week or month format, and see their tasks on it.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e76l27437"><span >8. Onedrive </span></h2>
<p><strong>Purpose: Cloud Storage  </strong></p>
<p><span ><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Website</a></span><span >, </span><span ><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-onedrive/id477537958" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">iOS</a></span><span >, </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.skydrive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Android </a></p>
<p><span >OneDrive cloud storage is preinstalled on Windows 10, however, it can also be used on a Mac. We are used to the fact that iCloud and Google Drive are clouds for personal files. OneDrive will work as a worker. </span></p>
<p><span >5 GB is free. By features, the application is not inferior to competitors. Synchronization between computers, support for mobile platforms, file sharing, online backup of files, storage of various file versions, advanced access rights, customizable access levels, administration console, network control - all these functions OneDrive supports. </span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e76l2pvu8"><span >9. Blimb</span></h2>
<p><strong>Pupose: warm-up of eyes </strong></p>
<p><span ><a href="http://blimb.su/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Site</a></span></p>
<p><span >Warming up the eyes is just as important as warming up the back, neck, and limbs. 2-3 minutes of exercises on this site can restore the tone of the eye muscles.</span></p>
<p><span >The principle is this: a ball moves around the screen, your task is to follow it. At the end of the session, the eyes should feel better. </span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e76l3d669"><span >10. Anydesk </span></h2>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong><span ><strong> remote computer control</strong> </span></p>
<p><span ><a href="https://anydesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Website</a></span><span >, </span><span ><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/anydesk/id1176131273" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">iOS</a></span><span >, </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anydesk.anydeskandroid" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Android </a></p>
<p><span >Such programs provide remote access to third-party computers running the host application. AnyDesk is the fastest remote desktop management software on the market, according to its developers. </span></p>
<p><span >And if you look at its features, then their confidence is justified. AnyDesk shows high-performance thanks to the proprietary DeskRT video codec. Thanks to it, only changed sections are transmitted to the screen, which greatly saves traffic and reduces delays.</span></p>

                <p><span ><a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/review-evernote-vs-onenote-which-is-better-notes.html">Evernote</a> is a sync manager for your notes. You can create and edit notes through any computer that has a web browser installed, and through some types of mobile phones. You can save pictures, web pages, voice recordings, text, in general, whatever you want.</span></p>
<p><span >What is convenient is that when you draw a note written manually (unless of course, it is readable at all), Evernote will automatically recognize the text and save it in a separate file. Suppose you made some notes on paper during a meeting that you might find useful later. Paper can easily get lost, but Evernote will save all your notes. Take a picture of your notes, and then just upload them to Evernote. After that, they will not go anywhere from you.</span></p>
<p><span >Evernote can also help you control waste, save money and time.</span></p>
<p><strong><span >1. Use</span></strong><span > it to control your spending while traveling. When traveling, we often spend a lot of money, and then we can’t remember what this or that amount took. Evernote saves you from lengthy calculations.</span></p>
<p><strong><span >2. Record the</span></strong><span > prices of the same products in different stores, so that you can compare them later and make a purchase where it’s cheaper.</span></p>
<p><strong><span >3. Keep</span></strong><span > track of potential investment opportunities. Often reading ads or an article in a newspaper about the opportunity to invest money profitably, you do not have enough time to immediately understand everything in detail. Use Evernote to schedule this for later.</span></p>
<p><strong><span >4. Use</span></strong><span > Evernote in the library to jot down important information. Why carry a laptop with you when you can make the necessary notes with Evernote!</span></p>
<p><strong><span >5. Write down</span></strong><span > ideas for birthday gifts for relatives and friends. We often don’t know what to give them for their birthday, and, oddly enough, good ideas come up all of a sudden. Evernote helps you not to forget them.</span></p>
<p><span >In short, Evernote can make life easier for anyone with the most ordinary lifestyles.</span></p>

                <p><span >The world of music has changed.</span></p>
<p><span >Decades ago, if you were a musician and wanted to record an album ...</span></p>
<p><span >That you and the band played every night in the bars like damned ...</span></p>
<p><span >But everything has changed.</span></p>
<p><span >Today, in the production of music, there is a trend towards a transition to </span><em><span >home</span></em><span > studios.</span></p>
<p><span >Great music is constantly recorded in bedrooms, garages, and basements by ordinary people like us ...</span></p>
<p><span >Usually only with a computer, USB microphone and headphones.</span></p>
<p><span >Record a song, put it on the Internet, watch how it becomes popular ... the next day you are a star.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e5im4i3h0"><span >It is easy and simple due to Reason Studios. Here is the short intro about Reason Studio:</span></h3>
<p><span ><a href="https://patrickdearteaga.com/propellerhead-reason/" title="Reason Studios is a music production software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reason Studios</a>, turning the world’s music dreamers into music makers and inspiring them to keep dreaming.</span></p>
<p><span >As developers of the Reason platform of instruments, plugins, music production software and mobile app, Reason Studios inspired millions of users all over the world to create.</span></p>
<p><span >Whether you’re making your first beat, producing the next hit song, crafting your own sound, playing around with an idea, or just figuring stuff out—Reason Studios empower you to do it.</span></p>
<p><span >But before any of this happens, you first need to learn how the process of recording music happens.</span></p>
<p><span >Therefore, in this post, I will divide it into 4 steps ... from start to finish.</span></p>
<p><span >Let's start ...</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e5im4i3i1"><span >Step 1: Recording Process</span></h2>
<p><span >In the early era of sound recording ...</span></p>
<p><span >The recording process was much simpler than it is now.</span></p>
<p><span >Entire performances were recorded on one try, sometimes with one or two microphones.</span></p>
<p><span >However, today a more complex process is used, known as </span><strong><span >multi-channel recording</span></strong><span > ...</span></p>
<p><span >When each instrument is recorded separately and then inserted into the “mix”.</span></p>
<p><span >This method has 2 BIG advantages :</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span >It allows engineers to shape and modify the sound of each instrument independently of the others.</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span >It allows you to record all instruments in turn.</span></strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span >When this method appeared, one person became able to do something that previously required a team of sound engineers and musicians.</span></p>
<p><span >And although in reality, each engineer has his own process steps ...</span></p>
<p><span >When you are done with this, you are ready for the </span><strong><span >next phase</span></strong><span > ...</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e5im4i3i2"><span >Step 2: mount process</span></h2>
<p><span >Now that you have recorded the tracks, it is time to clean them up.</span></p>
<p><span >Because no matter how accurate you are when recording ...</span></p>
<p><span >There will always be SOME errors that can and should be fixed ...</span></p>
<p><span >Using the great editing tools now available in the Reason music production software.</span></p>
<p><span >Typically, mounting includes 5 tasks :</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span >Ordering</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span >Comparison</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span >Noise suppression</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span >Time adjustment</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span >Sound adjustment</span></strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span >During </span><strong><span >ordering,</span></strong><span > you can once again listen to everything that you have done to evaluate what is good and what is bad.</span></p>
<p><span >For example, you can :</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span >delete whole useless tracks</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span >cut sections of tracks that interfere with the mix</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span >move sections to other parts of a song</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span >delete entire sections of a song together</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span >During the </span><strong><span >comparison,</span></strong><span > you compare the identical examination of each track and select the best.</span></p>
<p><span >With </span><strong><span >noise reduction,</span></strong><span > you cut out all the sounds before, after, and between the sections where the instrument is playing.</span></p>
<p><span >This means getting rid of :</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span >background voices</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span >amplifier hiss</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span >foot sounds</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span >creaks of a chair</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span >sounds of breathing</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span >or just stagnant air</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span >To further reduce noise, you can add a high-pass filter to the lower frequency range of </span><em><span >non-bass</span></em><span > instruments to get rid of rattling sounds.</span></p>
<p><span >When </span><strong><span >adjusting for sound,</span></strong><span > you can substitute any fake note back </span><em><span >into action</span></em><span > using </span><strong><span >auto-tuning</span></strong><span > or a similar instrument.</span></p>
<p><span >This is usually used for vocals but is also suitable for most melodic instruments.</span></p>
<p><span >This completes </span><strong><span >the mounting process</span></strong><span >.</span></p>
<p><span >Let's move on to the next step ...</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e5im4i3i3"><span >Step 3: The Mixing Process</span></h2>
<p><span >When the tracks are put in order as you need ...</span></p>
<p><span >The next goal is to make one connected record out of them ... by “ </span><strong><span >mixing</span></strong><span > ”.</span></p>
<p><span >Mixing in itself is a kind of art, and can occur in various ways ...</span></p>
<p><span >There are certain tasks that absolutely everyone does ...</span></p>
<p><span >Such as :</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span >Balance the volume</span></strong><span > so that no instrument sounds too loud or quiet in relation to others.</span></li>
<li><strong><span >Panning</span></strong><span >, which sets each instrument to its place in the </span><em><span >stereo image</span></em><span >, just like the musicians have their own place </span><em><span >on the stage</span></em><span >.</span></li>
<li><strong><span >Frequency correction</span></strong><span >, creating its place in the frequency spectrum of each instrument, so that sounds do not compete with each other for the frequency range.</span></li>
<li><strong><span >Compression</span></strong><span > equalizing the dynamic range of the instrument so that each note is clearly audible and the mix as a whole sounds louder.</span></li>
<li><strong><span >A reverb</span></strong><span > that creates a three-dimensional space for the mix, giving a sense of depth and making instruments sound like in </span><em><span >one room</span></em><span >.</span></li>
<li><strong><span >Automation</span></strong><span > allows you to change settings in different parts of the song, adding a sense of </span><em><span >movement to the</span></em><span > mix.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span >When will your mix be ready after using these instruments and when it will sound </span><em><span >great</span></em><span > ...</span></p>
<p><span >It’s time to move on to the next step ...</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e5im4i3i4"><span >Step 4: mastering process</span></h2>
<p><span >Before your song is ready for mastering ...</span></p>
<p><span >All tracks must be </span><em><span >rewritten</span></em><span > in one stereo file ...</span></p>
<p><span >Or, as they say, " </span><strong><span >merge into one</span></strong><span > ."</span></p>
<p><span >When this is done, you need to apply different </span><strong><span >mastering techniques</span></strong><span > to the song ...</span></p>
<p><span >To make it sound even </span><em><span >better</span></em><span >.</span></p>
<p><span >The following techniques are commonly used :</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span >Maximize the volume</span></strong><span > by further compressing and limiting the signal to maintain the average signal level at the highest level, but without sacrificing dynamics </span><em><span >too much</span></em><span >.</span></li>
<li><strong><span >Frequency balancing</span></strong><span > by further correction, as well as </span><em><span >multi-band compression</span></em><span >, which allows compressing frequency ranges separately from the entire spectrum.</span></li>
<li><strong><span >Stereo extension</span></strong><span > using a special plugin designed to create an additional feeling of “width” at high frequencies of the mix.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span >When everything sounds great, the track is converted to the appropriate </span><strong><span >sampling frequency and bit depth</span></strong><span >. For example, audio on a CD has a frequency of </span><strong><span >44.1 kHz</span></strong><span > and a depth of </span><strong><span >16 bits</span></strong><span >.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e5im4i3i5"><span >Do it yourself or delegate?</span></h3>
<p><span >Simply put, mastering is a </span><em><span >difficult</span></em><span > process. And if you do not understand what you are doing, then you can only </span><em><span >make</span></em><span > things </span><em><span >worse</span></em><span >.</span></p>
<p><span >Therefore, for intelligence engineers, the usual thing is to transfer this work into the hands of “ mastering engineers, ” rather than do it yourself.</span></p>
<p><span >But…</span></p>
<p><span >If you want to try, here are the apps that I recommend:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >Reason Studios - a music production software.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >On the </span><em><span >good</span></em><span > engineers mastering it is necessary to spend more money, which not everyone has or not everyone wants to spend.</span></p>
<p><span >Fortunately, today there are many freelance engineers who are willing to do this job for little money.</span></p>
<p><span >As I said earlier in this article, look for sites similar to </span><strong><span >Fiverr</span></strong><span >.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >See sample offers for everything related to sound ... including </span><strong><u><span >editing</span></u></strong><span >, </span><strong><u><span >mixing,</span></u></strong><span >  and </span><strong><span ><span style="text-decoration: underline;">mastering</span> </span></strong><span >at Reason Studio.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >Now…</span></p>
<p><span >Given the above, the next question ...</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e5im4i3i6"><span >Is mastering always necessary?</span></h3>
<p><span >Decades ago, when all studio recordings were for sale, </span><em><span >everything</span></em><span > worked out.</span></p>
<p><span >However, these days ... when many amateur recordings are made " </span><em><span >simply because</span></em><span > " ...</span></p>
<p><span >Home studios themselves do mastering or don't do it at all. And that is the norm.</span></p>
<p><span >If all you do is record music for family and friends, then who cares?</span></p>
<p><span >But…</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span >If you want to professionally record music or ...</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span >You just want her to sound the best ...</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span >Reason Studios - a music production software is MANDATORY.</span></p>

                <p>You don’t have to download and install the <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/5-important-things-about-skype-for-business.html">Skype Smartphone Application</a> or Skype for windows. You don’t even need to sign in.<br>Since we are all sitting at home now, video calling is needed more than ever. This is sometimes the only way to get in touch with family, friends, and sometimes the employer. The most popular video conferencing tool is Zoom. It allows you to make free 40-minute conference calls in which up to 100 people can participate. This allows for real online parties. But what if you need to talk continuously for several hours, when you, for example, work on a complex project or are just used to talking with a loved one for a long time?<br>So here old Skype comes to the rescue, which with the latest update has got a new Meet Now feature. It works: you click on the “Meeting” button in the installed Skype client or simply in the web interface in the browser. Copy the created link and send it to friends or colleagues. That's it, <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/how-to-use-viber-for-windows-featured-some-interesting-updates-including-video-chats.html">video conferencing</a> is created.<br>Anyone who has a link can join. No need to register or install Skype - everything works right in the browser.</p>

</figure>
<p>If you yourself do not use Skype, do not want to download it or enter the web client, you can still create a conference using a special page.<br>The number of voice communication participants should not exceed 50, but up to 600 people can be present in a text <br><br>There are no restrictions on the duration of the communication session - you can create a meeting in advance, and later join it. Call records are stored for 30 days, which is convenient for webinars and interviews.<br>In Skype, you can’t add cool backgrounds, like in Zoom, but you can blur the background behind you so that no one can see what mess you have. By default, this feature is already active.</p>

                    <img src="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/media/posts/199/smoke-1002461_640.jpg" alt="7 Cancer Prevention Tips to Reduce Risk" />
                <p id="mcetoc_1e4oas36s0">It is generally accepted that the risk of developing cancer depends on lifestyle. However, what is known today about its prevention (preventing cancer) is still at the stage of development and refinement.</p>
<p><span >Therefore, those who are interested in cancer prevention should follow these tips.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4oat20n1"><span >1. Stop smoking</span></h2>
<p><span >Using any type of tobacco is a risk of disease. Smoking is associated with various types of cancer: cancer of the lungs, mouth, throat, larynx, pancreas, bladder, cervix and kidney. Chewing tobacco more provokes cancer of the oral cavity and pancreas. Even if you do not smoke, exposure to secondhand smoke can increase your risk of developing lung cancer.</span></p>
<p><span >Quitting smoking is an important part of cancer prevention. If you need help with this, contact a specialist.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4oat9cl2"><span > 2. Follow a healthy diet</span></h2>
<p><span >Although choosing healthy foods cannot guarantee cancer prevention, it can reduce your risk. The following are recommendations:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Base your diet on fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based foods such as whole grains and beans.</span></li>
<li><span >Watch your weight. Choose low-calorie foods, including refined sugar and fat from animal sources.</span></li>
<li><span >Drink moderate amounts of alcohol. The risk of various types of cancer — including breast, colon, lung, kidney, and liver cancer — increases with the amount of alcohol consumed and the length of time it is consumed.</span></li>
<li><span >Limit the consumption of processed meat. A report by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the cancer agency of the World Health Organization, concluded that eating large amounts of processed meat may slightly increase the risk of certain types of cancer.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >Also, women who use the Mediterranean diet with olive oil and mixed nuts are less likely to have breast cancer. The Mediterranean diet focuses mainly on plant foods such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes and nuts. People who follow the Mediterranean diet choose healthy fats, such as olive oil, rather than animal origin; fish instead of red meat.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4oatmq13"><span >3. Maintain a healthy weight and be physically active</span></h2>
<p><span >Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the risk of various types of cancer, including cancer of the breast, prostate, lung, colon and kidney.</span></p>
<p><span >Physical activity also matters. Besides being able to control your weight, physical activity alone can reduce the risk of breast and colon cancer.</span></p>
<p><span >Adults who participate in any physical activity receive certain health benefits. Essential health benefits will be at least 2.5 hours per week of moderate physical activity or 1.5 hours per week of active exercise. You can also combine moderate and vigorous activity. As a general goal, include at least 30 minutes of physical activity in your daily routine, and even more if you can.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4oau1gb4"><span >4. Protect from the sun</span></h2>
<p><span >Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, and at the same time one of the most preventable. Try these tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >Avoid the midday sun. Stay away from the sun from 10 to 16 hours, when the sun's rays are the strongest.</span></li>
<li><span >Stay in the shade. When you are outdoors, stay in the shade for as long as possible. Sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat also help.</span></li>
<li><span >Cover open areas. Wear loose clothing that covers as much of the skin as possible. </span></li>
<li><span >Do not save on sunscreen. Use a broad spectrum sunscreen with SPF. Apply it abundantly every two hours or more often, especially if you are in the sun.</span></li>
<li><span >Avoid tanning beds and tanning beds. They are just as harmful as the active sun rays.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4oauau45"><span >5. Get vaccinated</span></h2>
<p><span >Cancer prevention includes protection against some viral infections:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span >Hepatitis B. Hepatitis B may increase your risk of developing liver cancer. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for some high-risk adults:</span></li>
<li><span > people with transmitted infections;</span></li>
<li><span > people who take drugs (intravenously);</span></li>
<li><span > men who have intrest with men, and medical facilities and their employees who may be exposed to contaminated blood or body fluids.</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><span >Human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a transmitted virus that can lead to cancer of the cervix and other genital organs, as well as squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The HPV vaccine is recommended for girls and boys aged 11 and 12 years. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4oaulsh6"><span >6. Avoid risky behavior</span></h2>
<p><span >Another effective cancer prevention tactic is to avoid risky behavior that can lead to infections, which in turn can increase your risk of cancer. For instance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >Practice safe. Limit the number of your partners and use a condom during meet. The more partners you have, the more likely you are to get a transmitted infection, such as HIV or HPV. People with HIV or AIDS have a higher risk of developing cancer of the anus, liver, and lungs. HPV is most often associated with cervical cancer, but it can also increase the risk of developing cancer of the anus, penis, throat, vulva and vagina.</span></li>
<li><span >Use disposable needles for any injection. Sharing needles with people who use intravenous drugs can lead to HIV, as well as to hepatitis B and hepatitis C, which can increase the risk of developing liver cancer.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4oausps7"><span >7. Have a regular medical examination</span></h2>
<p><span >Regular examinations for various types of cancer, such as cancer of the skin, colon, cervix and breast, etc., can increase the chances of early diagnosis of cancer, then treatment is likely to be successful. </span></p>
