                <p><span >In this article, I have collected 5 reasons that, will make you think about using Google Doc.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1efr74bk40"><span >Google Docs is free</span></h2>
<p><span >You need to compare Google Dox not even with Word (a program for a computer), but with the Office 365 service. As you know, there the subscription is paid monthly or for a year.</span></p>
<p><span >You don't have to pay anything at Google Doc. Except when there are a lot of files on your Disk. Then you will have to buy additional space. But filling 15 GB of free space with texts is a difficult problem, you are unlikely to succeed.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1efr74bk41"><span >Google Docs is easy to use through a browser</span></h2>
<p><span >To be fair, I note that Microsoft Office now has an online editor. If you have a Microsoft account, you can safely edit your texts online.</span></p>
<p><span >But the functionality of Microsoft's online editor will unpleasantly surprise fans of a text editor for the Word computer. Many features have been removed. Others work with limitations.</span></p>
<p><span >In Google Dox, the functionality is the same everywhere: on a computer, on a phone, on a tablet. You can launch a regular browser and use the service without installing any programs.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1efr74bk42"><span >Google Docs is more convenient for group work</span></h2>
<p><span >Often in life, you need to discuss a text with colleagues or friends. Sending it by message. If the text is more than three paragraphs, then how will the interlocutor tell you his thoughts on its content?</span></p>
<p><span >Google Docs comes to the rescue. It is not necessary that all participants in the discussion have a Google account. Email from other operators will do just as well.</span></p>
<p><span >You can log in without authorization and leave comments in the document anonymously. Unless, of course, you will not be stopped by the fact that you will be introduced to the discussion participants.</span></p>
<p><span >Comments can be discussed. Your answer will be recorded below, the history of your correspondence will be saved.</span></p>
<p><span >Through Google Docs, it turned out to be convenient to agree on plans and standards for the interaction of projects in which more than two parties are involved. It came in handy for me at work.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1efr74bk43"><span >Google Docs is handy on your phone</span></h2>
<p><span >I never thought that texts on the phone could be relatively convenient to edit. But it turned out that this is possible. Not only without functionality limitations, but even with a couple of new, in comparison with a computer editor, chips. For example, mobile dox is able to add words, you can dictate text. The mobile keyboard also helps.</span></p>
<p><span >By the way, you can also dictate text on a computer using Ctrl-Shift-S.</span></p>
<p><span >It is clear that all mobile platforms are supported: existing (Google and Apple) and any new ones (via a web browser that is in any operating system).</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1efr74bk44"><span >Google Docs is growing faster</span></h2>
<p><span >The rapid development of Google's text editor is understandable. The functionality has not yet caught up with Word, so new features appear frequently. For example, text comparison has recently appeared.</span></p>
<p><span >And here's another trick that hasn't appeared in paid Word for decades. If you typed the text in the wrong layout, in Google Docs you can fix it with one mouse button.</span></p>
<p><span >In order to work with text without an Internet connection, open offline access to it.</span></p>
<p><span >The file will update in the cloud the next time you connect to the network.</span></p>

                <p><strong><span >Many of us have played one of the most popular computer game, Minecraft. This is loved by millions, it has won the hearts of people of all generations from toddlers to the elderly, but few people know that Minecraft can be played on a phone running Android. All you have to do is download and install it.</span></strong></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1eeqijqf50"><span >Minecraft for Android</span></h2>
<p><span >The mobile version for playing Minecraft differs slightly from the computer one, although the game was practically rewritten from scratch. Developers are simultaneously updating both series - computer (Java Edition) and pocket (Pocket Edition). This means that the mobile version of the game already contains new blocks and that fans have liked so much. To play Minecraft version on your phone, you just need to download minecraft 1.14 on your phone and install it!Â </span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1eeqijqf71"><span >Installing Minecraft on Android</span></h2>
<p><span >There are two ways to install a game on your phone. The first method is official, it requires an installed Play Store. When installing a game from the Play Store, you will have to pay for it, as the game is paid.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1eeqijqf72"><span >Official way</span></h3>
<p><span >Go to the play store and click the Buy button. After paying for the purchase, the game will be installed automatically.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1eeqijqf73"><span >Features:</span></h2>
<p><span >The mobile version of the game supports not an only single-player mode but also playing on the server. You can also use various console commands, install your favorite free updates to diversify the gameplay.</span></p>
<p><span >The mobile version of the game is less resource-demanding than the computer version. Despite this, in terms of its capabilities, it is not inferior in anything. The only thing you have to get used to is management. In other words, experienced players are not inconvenienced by this.</span></p>
<p><span >The movement is controlled by the thumb of the left hand; it is more convenient to control the inventory with two hands. It is better to attack with your right hand to have moved during the attack.</span></p>

                <p><strong><span >Smartphones are not made for only make calls but You can install almost any application for study or work on a smartphone, as well as a messenger or client of a popular social network. Moreover, such devices perfectly replace a computer, allowing you to watch videos or movies. It's just that it's extremely inconvenient to do this on a small screen, so many people connect their phone via Wi-Fi to a TV. Let's see how to enable Miracast on Android and display the image and videos from the smartphone screen to a SmartTV.</span></strong></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1eeeraarp0"><span >What is streaming on Android?</span></h2>
<p><span >Previously, to connect a <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/smartphones-2/">smartphone</a> to a TV, you had to use an HDMI cable, which caused certain inconveniences. For example, the cord could be damaged, and the device must have been at a close distance to the monitor. But a few years ago, third-party developers introduced technology for remote transmission of information, called Miracast.</span></p>
<p><span >For this option to work, the TV and the phone must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network. There are no more restrictions. After activating the mode, it will be possible to display the image and videos from the smartphone on the TV screen or another monitor. That is, you can watch TV shows or <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/5-best-smartphone-to-optimize-your-gaming-experience.html">play games on the large display</a>.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1eeeraart1"><span >How to enable Miracast on Android?</span></h2>
<p><span >So, in this section, we proceed to its activation on the smartphone. Note that the broadcast is only available to users of smartphones with Android 4.2 and higher. Unfortunately, outdated phones do not allow image and video transmission to the TV screen. So, if you have an updated smartphone, you can enable Miracast, follow these steps:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >Open the settings.</span></li>
<li><span >Go to the "Connection and Sharing" section.</span></li>
<li><span >Go to the "Broadcast" tab.</span></li>
<li><span >Next to the item "Broadcast", move the slider to the right to activate the mode.</span></li>
<li><span >Now turn on Wi-Fi on the TV and go to the menu with a connection to the phone. </span><span >If you having difficulty finding this option, comment bellow your SmartTv Model and manufacturer name I will suggest the ways of option, or I also recommend that you read the manufacturer's instructions.</span></li>
<li><span >Find the TV model in the list on the smartphone and click on it.</span></li>
<li><span >Wait for the smartphone to connect to the TV.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >You can also use the "Wireless Display" option. It practically does not differ from the previous version and allows you to display the image from the phone to a computer monitor or TV. Here's how to enable it in the settings:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >Open the "Connection and Sharing" tab.</span></li>
<li><span >Go to the "Wireless Display" section.</span></li>
<li><span >Next to the item of the same name, move the slider to the right.</span></li>
<li><span >In the list, we find the model of your TV or monitor and connect.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >And if your phone cannot start screen broadcasting through the settings, then you can install the Miracast application from the Play Store. After the installation is complete, open the utility, click on the "Connect" button and select the name of the TV or monitor from the list.</span></p>
<p><span >So now you know how to enable Miracast on Android. All options and control can be found in the settings of the smartphone, so there shouldn't be any problems. And if you still have questions, be sure to write them in the comments. We will try to answer them and help you!</span></p>

                    <img src="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/media/posts/212/web-3967926_640.jpg" alt="5 benefits of getting managed web hosting" />
                <p><span >If you are planning to start your online career, surely you need a website to show your products. All online businesses rely on website hosting to keep them online and connected to the world. There was a time when more people preferred to take full responsibility for their online servers. But today's world is faster and busier. That is why they prefer to purchase managed web hosting. Here I have to guide you on why you should also do the same.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1ednt6cls0"><strong><span >Save on operating expenses</span></strong></h3>
<p><span >Many people have the misconception that acquiring managed hosting is more expensive because you also have to pay for the service. You realize how wrong it is only after having experienced it. There are many lower and hidden costs of managing accommodation yourself. You have to invest in a lot of resources, and even then, you won't get the results you expected.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1ednt6clt1"><strong><span >No need to hire support staff</span></strong></h3>
<p><span >It's not just about one person's job. You need database administrators, system administrators, and support staff to ensure that your servers stay online and up and running. A minor problem can cost your business a lot. If you buy managedÂ </span><u><span ><a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/why-wordpress-what-are-the-advantages.html">WordPress hosting</a>,</span></u><span >Â you won't have to invest in hiring and retaining a team of professionals.</span></p>
<p><span >The service provider will already have the best professionals on the job. They are more experienced in hosting management than you are with many resources you can probably afford.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1ednt6clt2"><strong><span >Safer and more maintained</span></strong></h3>
<p><span >Managed hosting service providers use security and seamless maintenance as their unique selling points. Online threats have only increased over time. Some do it for fun and others for ransom. You won't have the resources and personnel to fight an army ofÂ haters who are always looking for weaknesses to exploit.</span></p>
<p><span >A professional service that manages website hosting for a living would know exactly how to fend off any attack that might come this way. They will keep their hosting optimized and updated to guarantee the best performance. This will take a lot of your worries off your shoulders.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1ednt6clu3"><strong><span >24 Hours monitoring</span></strong></h3>
<p><span >The employees you hire will only work hours before. They will also need casual, medical, and other permits. The hosting requires full-time monitoring to make sure everything continues to run smoothly. This means that you can hire a staff of three different hours with support staff or purchase managed accommodation. The last option is definitely more efficient and cheaper.</span></p>
<p><span >All of these service providers offerÂ </span><u><span >24-hour monitoring</span></u><span >. First, they keep everything so well maintained so there is no problem. On top of that, they keep an alert staff on call to predict any potential problems before they happen and resolve them without you noticing.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1ednt6clu4"><strong><span >Get the best out of your backup</span></strong></h3>
<p><span >Not keeping a backup of your data is not a smart move in the 21st century. People use backup copies to protect even personal data. So there shouldn't be a question of not keeping your business data backed up. The problem, the backup also requires a safe space and a system that automatically updates the data. Instead of investing more in backups and Shared hosting at the same time, it is more viable to acquire a professional service that can do it for you.</span></p>

                <p id="mcetoc_1ec32jnda0"><span >Publishing videos in TikTok is pretty easy thanks to the built-in editor. To add special effects, you can use effects inside the editor, as well as special masks and filters. In the video, you can legally add any track from the free library of the application, or upload your audio.</span></p>
<p><span >Popular TikToker are already actively monetizing their accounts. How to profit from your TikTok account in 2020? We will analyze the proven methods:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span >Native advertising</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span >Itâs acceptable to advertise other accounts, brands, products, and services. This is a well-known format that is already successfully sold on Instagram. Experienced bloggers recommend observing the main rule of native advertising: we focus on the quality of content, advertising should be no more than 30%.</span></p>
<p><span >Let's analyze one of the options for native advertising in TikTok. Suppose a music group has recorded a new track and wants to attract the attention of the audience to this event. Next, the group manager looks for bloggers with a suitable target audience and buys a placement from them (prices depending on the popularity of the tiktoker). The placement may be a video recording for the specified track.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span >Live broadcasts</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span >Some time ago, TikToker blew up the story of a professional player from China. Meng Lei streamed his game in the application, one of these broadcasts gathered 22 million viewers who sent donations to the player for 1 million yuan, which amounted to about 167 thousand dollars!</span></p>
<p><span >That is, another option for monetizing an account in TikTok is to receive donations (thanks in monetary terms, in the application it is called coins or tips, in an average of 100 coins it costs about $ 1) from the audience. Such broadcasts are available for tickers with many followers from 1000, TikTok will take 20% of donations. Amounts can be withdrawn to a bank card or online wallet, withdrawal is available from $ 10.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span >Influence marketing</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span >The large reach in TikTok surely attracts large and medium-sized advertisers, despite the inability to put a direct link to your project. In-app advertising inspires user confidence and strengthens the brand position. This type of monetization is available to bloggers from 10-20 thousand subscribers. Usually, influence-marketing in TikTok includes the following activities:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><em><span >creating viral videos</span></em></li>
<li><em><span >Challenges</span></em></li>
<li><em><span >publishing brand hashtags videos</span></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Â </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span >Affiliate Programs</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span >A popular tikToker can become a member of the affiliate program and receive deductions from going to the page or selling the advertised product. The blogger is required to put the right link under the video and motivate the audience to follow it. These methods of promotion are actively used by traffic arbitrators.</span></p>
<p><span >Typically, such a scheme works as follows: an interesting video is posted in TikTok, but in an incomplete form, under the video, there is a link to another social network (YouTube or Instagram) and from there, there is a redirect to an affiliate link (either in the profile header or in the story). The application has proven itself in partnerships with offers for clothing, cosmetics, and products in general for a young audience, as well as for the games and entertainment industry.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span >Attracting customers to the business</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span >TikTok works great as an additional advertising channel for attracting customers to online and offline businesses. The best performance so far in the niches voiced in the paragraph above. The specifics of the audience are affected, the products âfor the youth audienceâ most likely âenterâ.</span></p>
<p><span >In the application, you can get wide coverage with the help of a catchy viral video. However, there are limitations: you cannot configure an exact target by parameters, for example, by geolocation.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span >TikTok manager</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span >The demand for promotion in TikTok has thrown the work of SMM-managers. The new social network requires new skills, mainly related to the preparation of video content. Most often, the tasks of a tiker manager include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><em><span >promotion strategy planning,</span></em></li>
<li><em><span >scripting videos,</span></em></li>
<li><em><span >terms of reference for photographers and videographers,</span></em></li>
<li><em><span >account promotion</span></em></li>
<li><em><span >communication and engagement of the audience, activity planning,</span></em></li>
<li><em><span >communication with brands and customers for advertising.</span></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span >Conclusion:</span></strong><span >Â TikTok enters everyday life with huge turns and is gaining popularity. If you spend time recording videos, itâs just silly not to take advantage of monetization opportunities. It is important to remember some of the limitations that the new social network imposes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >you need to prepare for the difficulties and not abandon the work with accounts in other popular social networks. Reason: TikTok does not yet allow direct links to anything other than its social networks;</span></li>
<li><span >age restrictions: earning in Tik-Tok is officially possible only from the age of 18 or with the consent of the parents.</span></li>

                <p><strong><em><span >Today it is impossible to live a day without going online</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span >But there are various threats in the form of tracking user activity on the Internet and this is depressing. However, there are ways to protect yourself.Â </span><strong><span >VPN (Virtual Private Network) service</span></strong><span >Â is a great way to provide a secure online network connection. The VPN also allows you to protect your browsing history and access to content that is blocked or limited at the regional level.</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1eb9043a90"><strong><em><span >In this article, we will consider the TOP-3 of the best VPN services in 2020! first, you need to understand what does a VPN does?. So let's go!</span></em></strong></h3>
<p><span >Each of your devices (computer, smartphone, tablet, etc.) has its unique IP address, which tells the services who you are, what you are doing and where you are.Â </span><strong><span >A VPN is located between your device and the Internet service provider (ISP).</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span >When a user logs on to the network, the</span></strong><span >Â VPN "spoofs" the deviceâs IP address. Everything that you do on the network, first goes through a VPN, then to the router - as a result, your router (and everything that is outside of your device) thinks that you have aÂ </span><strong><span >different identity.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span >A VPN is very useful</span></strong><span >Â when you plan to connect to the Internet through an insecure connection (a network that does not ask for your password), for example, in a cafe, because it stores all kinds of information about youÂ </span><strong><span >(for example, the history of visited pages and any data you transmit) .</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span >A VPN even has other features,</span></strong><span >Â such as access to content, which may be limited geographically, as it allows you to view the contents of web pages as if you are in another place (city, country, continent).</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1eb9043a91"><span >How to choose the right VPN</span></h2>
<p><span >If you have chosen a free VPN, itâs simple enough to start working with it: just select a VPN service, register on the website of the developer company and download the client.</span></p>
<p><strong><span >Here are a few features to consider when choosing a VPN.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span >Many servers:</span></strong><span >Â the more servers the VPN service has, the higher the connection speed and, as a rule, you will have more options for connecting to the selected country. This means that you most likely will not have to deal with buffering problems.</span></li>
<li><strong><span >Multi-device connectivity:</span></strong><span >Â Â if you need to connect more than one device to VPN simultaneously, you need more power.Â </span><strong><span >The best VPNs</span></strong><span >Â allow you to connect up to 5 devices at the same time, if not more.</span></li>
<li><strong><span >Ease of use:</span></strong><span >Â Â for beginners in a VPN, itâs important to have a clean and well-defined interface, as well as easy access to customer support. ForÂ </span><strong><span >experienced users, an</span></strong><span >Â application that is customizable and allows you to work with additional functions, such as a network switch, data compression (for mobile devices) and automatic HTTPS redirection, will be convenient.</span></li>
<li><strong><span >Great security and no registration.Â </span></strong><span >Â Good VPN services will not track, register or sell your personal information - for example, which websites you visited. They also guarantee that they protect you with strong encryption (256-bit AES) and regular security checks - theÂ </span><strong><span >most important criterion when choosing a VPN in 2020!</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1eb9043a92"><strong><span >To make life easier for my readers, I picked up TOP-3 of the best free VPN services in 2020 . You can not worry, they are completely safe!</span></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1eb907tlp8"><em>ExpressVPN</em>Â - the<em>Â best in my opinion</em></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em><span >ExpressVPNÂ </span></em></strong><span >is my choice of the fastest and most powerful VPN service. It is great for getting through any blocked websites and protecting your computer.</span></p>
<p><span >In its arsenal, the service has more than 30,000 IP addresses, 160 server locations in 94 countries and more than 3,000 available servers. It is also backed by a strict privacy policy,Â </span><strong><span >available without registration</span></strong><span >Â , so you can continueÂ </span><strong><span >to surf with peace of mind.</span></strong></p>
<p><span >Even more impressive is the fact that the service is available on a wide variety of platforms:Â </span><strong><span >Mac, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS.</span></strong></p>
<p><span >Want your smart TVs, routers and game consoles to beÂ </span><strong><span >protected by VPN</span></strong><span >? InÂ </span><strong><em><span >ExpressVPN</span></em></strong><span >Â have theirÂ </span><strong><span >firmware for them</span></strong><span >Â , as well as extensions for browsers.Â </span><strong><span >The Android app</span></strong><span >Â works even on aÂ </span><strong><span >Chromebook</span></strong><span >Â .</span></p>
<p><strong><span >As for the enhanced version,</span></strong><span >Â ExpressVPN also offers split tunneling, a network lock switch, server speed tests, zero-knowledge DNS, and unlimited bandwidth.</span></p>
<p><span >ExpressVPN has tons of tutorials and manuals that you can learn, as well as 24-hour online chat support, so you can get started right away.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1eb907k1u7">TunnelbearÂ - Best Budget VPN</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span >A</span></strong><span >n extremely user-friendly interface, this is a great option for those who are not familiar with VPNs. Its free access is limited to 500 MB per month, and if you need more, the cheapest subscription option starts at $ 4.95 per month, giving you unlimited secure access to up to 5 devices and priority customer service.</span></p>
<p><span >Even though the nice graphic design makes the service fun and affordable,Â </span><strong><span >Tunnelbear shines with</span></strong><span >Â its incredibly amazing privacy policy. He will never register or sell your activity history on the Internet, and will also conduct independent annual service auditsÂ </span><strong><span >- something you will not see in most other VPNs.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span >Tunnelbear is</span></strong><span >Â a simpler and less powerful VPN service, but it is a great option for beginners and those who donât care about the many settings and advanced features. It has only about 22 server seats and 1800 servers, so it is comfortable for working in a cafe, but probably not ideal for active users.</span></p>
<p><strong><span >Tunnelbear is</span></strong><span >Â also available on Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android, and there are browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1eb9075su6"><strong>IPVanish - the best VPN for connecting multiple devices</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span >If you need to connect multiple devices to a VPN at the same time,Â </span><strong><span >IPVanish</span></strong><span >Â ($ 10 / month) is the perfect choice for your purpose. With it, you can connect up toÂ </span><strong><span >10 devices</span></strong><span >Â at the same time without problems.</span></p>
<p><strong><span >IPVanish</span></strong><span >Â has excellent statistics, offering over 1300 anonymous servers in more than 75 locations and 40,000 shared IP addresses. It also has a clear zero-log privacy policy and keeps your data safe withÂ </span><strong><span >256-bit AES encryption.</span></strong></p>
<p><span >This VPN service has convenient applications for all platforms and devices:Â </span><strong><span >Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, Chrome OS, Fire TV and WiFi routers.</span></strong></p>
<p><span >All applications are feature rich and feature options such asÂ </span><strong><span >automatic IP address switching</span></strong><span >Â . One of the mainÂ </span><strong><span >disadvantages of</span></strong><span >Â IPVanish is that its interface is not as accessible and intuitive as others - therefore,Â </span><strong><span >it may not be the best choice for novice users.</span></strong></p>
<p><span >Nevertheless, thanks to round-the-clock customer support, users can quickly get answers to questions when they need it most.</span></p>

<p><span >We reviewed theÂ </span><strong><span >TOP-3 of the best free VPN services in 2020,</span></strong><span >Â each of which has its advantages and disadvantages, which can be solved, for the most part, by purchasing advanced access or a premium account.</span></p>
<p><strong><span >You can download and use any of the above VPN services for free.</span></strong></p>

                <p><span >In this post, we will know some best open-source software for our computer. Why use open source software? Firstly, they are free. Secondly, they are safe, as their development is supported and verified by a large community around the world. In my opinion, here are 11 of the best programs,Â </span></p>
<p><span >Please note that a lot of open sources programs have been developed for various tasks. It is impossible to cover everything. However, this is what I consider the best for the end-user.Â </span><strong><span >However, be sure to write to me in the comments which programs you prefer.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Brave Browser</strong></p>
<p><strong><span >Platforms:</span></strong><span >Â Â Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android</span></p>

<p><span >In terms of security, Brave browser supports end-to-end data encryption, built-in VPN, and decentralized applications, allows you to work with magnet links.</span></p>
<p><span >Also, it pays users for viewing advertisements with native Basic Attention Tokens. To do this, a crypto wallet that supports BAT is integrated into the browser.</span></p>
<p><span >The browser is very fast and easy to use, as it is based on the open-source Chromium browser. It is still lagging behind the big players when it comes to supporting extensions, but given its rapid development, we can expect that things will change very soon.</span></p>
<p><strong>2. LibreOffice</strong></p>
<p><strong><span >Platforms:</span></strong><span >Â Â Windows, Mac, Linux</span></p>
<p><span >This office suite has a traditional and familiar interface, as well as the fact that it includes the working equivalents of Microsoft Word, Excel, Publisher, Powerpoint, and Access. This is perhaps the most useful free open-source package you will find.</span></p>
<p><span >LibreOffice has excellent compatibility with many formats - from Microsoft proprietary formats to less well-known ones - and is constantly evolving.Â </span><span >The next step we will wait for is some kind of cloud storage!</span></p>

<p><strong>4. Notepad ++</strong></p>
<p><strong><span >Platforms:</span></strong><span >Â Â Windows</span></p>
<p><span >Experienced users do not need to talk about Notepad ++. This is a great tool for programmers and experienced users with support for programming languages ââand syntax highlighting.</span></p>
<p><span >Notepad ++ also offers an excellent tab system that allows you to work with multiple files simultaneously. The program remembers open tabs, so you can continue to work from the place where you left off, even after restarting the computer.</span></p>

<p><strong><span >Platforms:</span></strong><span >Â Â Windows, Mac, Linux</span></p>

People are forced to stay at home, therefore, by any means maintain contact with each other. In this regard, new calling application CatchUp will be an excellent assistant, since the program offers simple calls - such as during the time of conventional push-button phones. According to studies, one of the main reasons people donât call friends, relatives, and friends more often is that they donât know when they are ready to talk to them. Often people worry that they can call at an uncomfortable time. but CatchUp solves this problem.
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e9lo9c7v0">Important features of CatchUp Application.</h2>
In the CatchUp application, users can indicate that they are ready for a conversation by setting the appropriate status. It will be visible to all other participants. In addition to individual calls, CatchUp also has group calls, which are easy to join. The program is not related to the Facebook application, so users do not need to have a social network account. Linking is carried out by phone number, as in any other messenger, so you can even chat with those who do not have a Facebook account.<br>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e9lo9p321">How to use CatchUp Application.</h2>
<p>CatchUp is currently being tested in the US on iOS and Android. Since this is an experimental product, I hope Facebook will release and updates all over the world as soon as possible.</p>

                    <img src="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/media/posts/207/voice-search-1792301_640.png" alt="How to set up Google Assistant on Android with Action Block" />
                <p><span >I love Google Assistant and use it regularly. Unlike Siri on iOS, the voice assistant of the Google Assistant is more deeply integrated with Android and allows you to interact with the operating system with great convenience. You can ask him to translate the text, find the right product on the Internet from a photograph, read out the contents of the website, return the application that was mistakenly bought on Google Play, not to mention controlling music playback, setting alarms, and more. However, because it was possible to manage the Google Assistant only by voice or through correspondence, many avoided using it, hesitating to contact their phone. Itâs good that Google understood this.</span></p>
<p><span >Google has launched the Action Blocks app for Android. It allows you to create a kind of shortcut for the Google Assistant quick commands that you can place on your desktop and activate the necessary actions without speaking to the assistant by voice. That is Action Blocks is an analog of Siri Shortcuts on iOS, and its key difference from the proprietary Apple application is a less extensive set of functions, although Google Assistant itself will be more capable than Siri. However, the purpose of Action Blocks is a bit different.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e90sme1a0"><span >How Google Assistant with Action block Quick Commands Work</span></h2>
<p><span >The goal of Action Blocks is not to expand the capabilities of the device, like Siri Shortcuts, which adds functionality to the device but to simplify the interaction with it. Suppose, earlier, to set the alarm, you should first call the assistant, then say the appropriate command, set the time, check whether he understood you correctly, and only then confirm the action. With Action Blocks, you can make Google Assistant remember the action you need, save it, and you just click on the shortcut on the desktop to activate it.</span></p>
<p>Read: <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/5-useful-google-chrome-browser-features-you-need-to-know.html">5 useful Google Chrome browser feature </a></p>
<p><span >While the Action Blocks application is available only in English, which, however, will not prevent you from downloading it. At the time of publication, the development is already available in the Russian segment of the Google Play catalog and is distributed free of charge. Well, to make it easier for you to understand the features of the program and configure everything the way you want, although its interface is as simple and logical as possible, I offer you this short instruction.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e90sme1b1"><span >How to create a quick command for Google Assistant using Action Block Application</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span >Download Action Block on your smartphone and activate it;</span></li>
<li><span >Click Create Action Block to create a shortcut with the command;</span></li>
<li><span >Select a command from the proposed ones or click Create custom action to create your own;</span></li>
<li><span >Click on the microphone icon and say a command with your voice or write it on the keyboard;</span></li>
<li><span >Click Test action to make sure that Google Assistant correctly recognized the command;</span></li>
<li><span >Select an icon for a shortcut with a quick command and name it;</span></li>
<li><span >Save the quick command and place it on your desktop.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >In my opinion, Action Blocks could be a decisive factor in favor of promoting Google Assistant. Not only that, thanks to the shortcuts with quick commands, the assistant will be able to use those who were embarrassed to use their smartphone's voice, but they will also help facilitate the use of older people. Practice shows that most users of advanced age interact with their smartphones only within a certain functional circle. However, with shortcuts, they can do much more without having to remember ways to activate certain features.</span></p>

                <p><span >We go to dozens of sites every day, this is called "web surfing." In this article, let's understand how sites work, and what does web hosting have to do with it.</span></p>
<p><span >When you need to go to any site, we open a browser and write the name of the site, or rather a <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/earning-money-from-domain-parking-basic-ideas.html">domain name</a>. It consists of the name and designation of the domain zone, for example, the domain "thetrickspeak.com" refers to the zone "global". Next, the browser needs to convert the alphabetic name to the digital address of the site - IP (Internet Protocol). Text names were invented for the convenience of using the Internet, but in reality, only digital IP addresses are âunder the hoodâ.</span></p>
<p><span >For mapping domains with IPs, a global database of Domain Name System (DNS) names is used.</span></p>
<p><span >When the IP is found, the browser accesses this address and starts <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/3-free-ways-to-download-youtube-videos.html">downloading</a> the site files. These files must be stored somewhere, this place is called web hosting. That is, hosting is a place on the Internet, the server where the site âlivesâ. Web hosting is provided by hosting providers. The stability of work and the speed of loading the site directly depend on the quality of the hosting. Hosting service is paid, and prices vary depending on requirements, from $ 1 per month. There are thousands of providers now, so itâs better to understand factors before buying any hosting for your website.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e8f6nnv40"><span >Hosting Features</span></h2>
<p><span ><a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/web-hosting-solution-for-small-business.html">Hosting</a> not only contains site files, but it is also a complex system that includes several basic modules:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >Name Server (DNS).</span></li>
<li><span >File storage.</span></li>
<li><span >Programming language handlers.</span></li>
<li><span >Database servers.</span></li>
<li><span >Backup system.</span></li>
<li><span >HTTP server.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >The name server stores a database of domains and IP addresses. These databases are synchronized with each other and, theoretically, the same database on all hosting sites. Your ISP has the same database.</span></p>
<p><span >The file server provides disk space. There are several basic file types used for the site:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >HTML is the source code of the page that is loaded into the browser.</span></li>
<li><span >PHP - code in the programming language PHP.</span></li>
<li><span >CSS - styles for visualizing content.</span></li>
<li><span >JS - code in the Javascript programming language.</span></li>
<li><span >JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP - pictures, photos.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >You can, of course, store any files, but the described types are used on most pages on the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span >On the Internet, some sites were static. This means that the hosting kept ready-made files that the browser simply downloaded and rendered the page. Now the sites are dynamic, i.e. the finished HTML file does not lie on the server, but it needs to be generated. This happened because there were content management systems (CMS), for example, WordPress.</span></p>
<p><span >CMS uses programming languages ââand databases. Different information is stored across dozens of tables in the database. With the help of a code, information is collected according to a given algorithm and a page is formed.</span></p>
<p><span >Thus, you can generate millions of pages, and you do not need to store HTML files for each. But most importantly, it is easy to change something immediately on all pages of the site. Web hosting can interpret code in programming languages. The most popular are PHP, Perl, Python, ASP.NET, node.js. When choosing a hosting, pay attention above things</span></p>
<p><span >The HTTP server accepts the connection from the browser and gives the files. If the page is static, then the HTTP server simply downloads the HTML file, and if it is dynamic, it will first transfer control to the interpreter and then take the HTML code from it. Hosting ability to process a large number of connections, i.e. visitors, depends on the HTTP server.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e8f6nnv51"><span >Types of Hosting</span></h2>
<p><span >The described model is called "Shared hosting", also called virtual or private. With shared hosting, a site is allocated disk space and a processor time limit for processing commands. As a rule, this limit is small, since hundreds of sites use one server, hence the name - âcommonâ. This is the most inexpensive and common type of hosting.</span></p>
<p><span >Shared hosting has disadvantages:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >Limited computing resources.</span></li>
<li><span >You can not change the software environment.</span></li>
<li><span >Server settings are very limited.</span></li>
<li><span >The security of all sites is interconnected.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >But there are advantages:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >Low cost.</span></li>
<li><span >Everything works out of the box.</span></li>
<li><span >Server administration is entirely in the hands of technical support.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >Serious web owner does not use shared hosting, although large content resources may remain here. In fact, shared hosting can withstand impressive traffic if you turn a dynamic site into a static one.</span></p>
<p><span >Caching plugins are used for this. It works simply: the first time you access the page, it, as expected, is generated by the engine from scratch. Then, the finished page is saved to an HTML file on disk, and the next time the hosting gives a static file.</span></p>
<p><span ><a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/web-hosting-solution-for-small-business.html">Shared hosting</a> does not guarantee a processor resource, and it is not measured at all. Some hosters have come up with an internal processor unit, such as 50 CPUs. The number does not allow you to somehow evaluate the load capacity of the server, but in this way, you can compare tariffs among themselves. This gives an understanding that a more expensive tariff is not only distinguished by available disk space, but also by an increased limit on the processor.</span></p>
<p><span >For guaranteed power they use virtual private servers - VPS / VDS. In this case, you get not just disk space for the site, but your own server. This means that you have your own operating system. On the OS, you can put any modules, programming languages, HTTP-servers, and databases.Â </span></p>
<p><span >There can be some analogy between VPS and Shared: instead of a piece of disk space, you get a piece of the server. One real server is divided into dozens of virtual servers. Guaranteed resources are determined by the VPS parameters:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span >The processor clock speed in MHz, for example, 2900 MHz.</span></li>
<li><span >The number of processor cores: from 1 to 32 and above.</span></li>
<li><span >The amount of RAM.</span></li>
<li><span >Disk space</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >VPS hosting launches online stores and services. If you need a complete server, then this is called a dedicated server rental. A physical server passes to your control, on which you can install your OS.</span></p>
<p><span >Unlike Shared, a dedicated server needs to be independently administered, to monitor health and safety. If at night the server freezes and the site stops working, then only you are responsible for this. In the case of Shared hosting, technical support will see that the server crashed and restore its operation.</span></p>
<p><span >Hosting is used not only for websites, but it is also a remote server to run applications. Sites run on Linux, programs run on Microsoft Windows. Conveniently, the servers work 24 hours a day, do not make noise, and do not take up space in the room. On a remote server, you can run a program that should work without interruption, and not require large processing power. For example, Windows hosting is used for the work of exchange robots.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e8f6nnv52"><span >Conclusions</span></h2>
<p><span >You need to carefully approach the choice of hosting provider services to host the site. After reviewing the available information, you can choose what the user needs in a particular situation: shared hosting or a VPS / VDS server. Both types of hosting have their pros and cons, choose what suits you best.</span></p>
