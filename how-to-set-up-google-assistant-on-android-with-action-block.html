Unlike Siri on iOS, the voice assistant of the Google Assistant is more deeply integrated with Android and allows you to interact with the operating system with great convenience. You can ask him to translate the text, find the right product on the Internet from a photograph, read out the contents of the website, return the application that was mistakenly bought on Google Play, not to mention controlling music playback, setting alarms, and more. However, because it was possible to manage the Google Assistant only by voice or through correspondence, many avoided using it, hesitating to contact their phone. It’s good that Google understood this.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Google has launched the Action Blocks app for Android. It allows you to create a kind of shortcut for the Google Assistant quick commands that you can place on your desktop and activate the necessary actions without speaking to the assistant by voice. That is Action Blocks is an analog of Siri Shortcuts on iOS, and its key difference from the proprietary Apple application is a less extensive set of functions, although Google Assistant itself will be more capable than Siri. However, the purpose of Action Blocks is a bit different.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How Google Assistant with Action block Quick Commands Work</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The goal of Action Blocks is not to expand the capabilities of the device, like Siri Shortcuts, which adds functionality to the device but to simplify the interaction with it. Suppose, earlier, to set the alarm, you should first call the assistant, then say the appropriate command, set the time, check whether he understood you correctly, and only then confirm the action. With Action Blocks, you can make Google Assistant remember the action you need, save it, and you just click on the shortcut on the desktop to activate it.</span></p><p>Read: <a href="https://www.thetrickspeak.com/5-useful-google-chrome-browser-features-you-need-to-know.html">5 useful Google Chrome browser feature</a></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the Action Blocks application is available only in English, which, however, will not prevent you from downloading it. At the time of publication, the development is already available in the Russian segment of the Google Play catalog and is distributed free of charge. Well, to make it easier for you to understand the features of the program and configure everything the way you want, although its interface is as simple and logical as possible, I offer you this short instruction.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How to create a quick command for Google Assistant using Action Block Application</span></h2><ul><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Download Action Block on your smartphone and activate it;</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Click Create Action Block to create a shortcut with the command;</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Select a command from the proposed ones or click Create custom action to create your own;</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Click on the microphone icon and say a command with your voice or write it on the keyboard;</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Click Test action to make sure that Google Assistant correctly recognized the command;</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Select an icon for a shortcut with a quick command and name it;</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Save the quick command and place it on your desktop.</span></li></ul><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In my opinion, Action Blocks could be a decisive factor in favor of promoting Google Assistant. Not only that, thanks to the shortcuts with quick commands, the assistant will be able to use those who were embarrassed to use their smartphone's voice, but they will also help facilitate the use of older people. Practice shows that most users of advanced age interact with their smartphones only within a certain functional circle. However, with shortcuts, they can do much more without having to remember ways to activate certain features.</span></p><p> Also read: <a
